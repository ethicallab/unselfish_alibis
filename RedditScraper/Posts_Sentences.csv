14xsvag,When to have my breaks inspected/serviced?
14xsvag,"My '21 (Q4 2020) M3 (LR AWD w/19"") is approaching 80K miles."
14xsvag,"Given that these cars don't typically require routine maintenance/inspections, how will I know when my friction brakes are getting low?"
14xsvag,When (how many miles?
14xsvag,) should I have them inspected/serviced?
14xsvag,Preferably before they start scoring the rotors.
14xsvag,I know everyone uses their brakes/drives their car differently.
14xsvag,"I use regenerative braking a lot, but I still use the friction brakes (usually briefly) at least 5-8 times per day over the course of \~140 miles daily."
14xsvag,These are mostly to assist Regen (decelerate/stop faster/in time) plus the occasional (0-1 /day) panic stop.
14xsvag,If there's two things I would complain about on my car it's the excessively harsh ride/suspension and the rather middling break performance.
14xsvag,"Yes, it's a very heavy car, but still I wish the friction brakes were more assertive."
1ccg6hp,FSD Supervised Needs Supervision It’s a complete downgrade from when I used it in 2022.
1ccg6hp,Summon: Its a broken feature.
1ccg6hp,I used the summon feature in parking lots on multiple occasions and the car literally takes the most direct route to me.
1ccg6hp,And I mean DIRECT.
1ccg6hp,Literally went over a parking lot median to try to get to me.
1ccg6hp,It’s an empty parking lot at that.
1ccg6hp,"The old version FSD, while it had its problems, would never do this."
1ccg6hp,Same parking lots from 2022.
1ccg6hp,Auto-park: EMBARRASSING.
1ccg6hp,FSD: LANE CHANGES.
1ccg6hp,Please for the love of god don’t forget to tap Minimal Lane Changes.
1ccg6hp,The car will switch lanes .
1ccg6hp,5 miles from your exit… in heavy traffic for “faster lane changing” or what ever it says.
1ccg6hp,AWARENESS and CRITICALITY.
1ccg6hp,The car will go 60mph or what ever your speed is 400 feet from a red light and will abuse the brakes on approach.
1ccg6hp,"Also, Plenty of times the car would zoom out of the far right lane into a turnaround/turning lane to the right thinking that’s the lane…even in situations where it should be able to see that the turn lanes end dangerously close for it to swerve into the lane AND keep its speed."
1ccg6hp,"ASSERTIVE, CHILL, AND I forget the other mode."
1ccg6hp,No explanation on what these modes really mean as it pertains to trafficability.
1ccg6hp,Considering the car is driving by itself this should be explained for obvious safety and intuitive reasons.
1ccg6hp,"Overall, it’s very embarrassing and nerve wracking to use."
1ccg6hp,Only useful when you are on a freeway driving a long linear route.
1ccg6hp,There’s autopilot for that.
1ccg6hp,Probably more that I am forgetting but these are some things I found extremely terrifying.
1ccg6hp,"Not sure if it’s because ppl complained about how cautious it used to be, but now FSD DGAF"
1bj0dnb,FSD V12.3 disables TACCPretty much in the heading .....
1bj0dnb,Got FSD v12.3 update this evening ..
1bj0dnb,"now Autopilot Activation (Single/Double Pull), in Car> Autopilot menu, is disabled if you enable ""Full Self Driving""...."
1bj0dnb,"Not that I ever used TACC, now that they disabled it, I miss it, lol :)"
yo3hka,Debating if I encountered a conman at my vehicle pick upI bought a used model 3 last week at Tesla store.
yo3hka,"Paid 600 deposit , went to the store , I saw the exterior of the vehicle and it looked good."
yo3hka,"I went inside the store and was trying to be polite with one senior sales guy and was asking , how can I see the vehicle interior before deciding if I should continue with the vehicle."
yo3hka,The guy immediately says to open my Tesla app and review the agreements and asked me to press ACCEPT DELIVERY so I can get the keys and check the vehicle interior.
yo3hka,I am wondering if it's misleading.
yo3hka,Would I have been able to return the vehicle if I found something wrong in the interior ?
yo3hka,"The vehicle turned out to be mostly good except for some bad smell , previous owner hairs and spit marks on the right door handles  Was the sales guy a conman for just focussing on just asserting me to press the ACCEPT DELIVERY button ?"
yo3hka,He also was rushing to close my case and send me out.
yo3hka,The reason I decided to shop at Tesla is to avoid conmen from regular car dealerships.
yo3hka,"Please let me know who is at wrong , and If I should bring this to Tesla's notice."
1854dvi,Follow distance settingI’ve been super lazy and ignored the change Tesla made several versions back.
1854dvi,I used to be able to set the AP follow distance by the scroll wheel left/right.
1854dvi,They seemed to have changed this and I can’t figure out an easy way to change this on the fly.
1854dvi,My right scroll wheel shows auto pilot options chill average or aggressive.
1854dvi,Does not adjust follow distance.
1854dvi,Curious what you all are doing with this and how to quickly get to it?
1854dvi,Thanks in advance.

qfncaf,The $2k test driveLast weekend I got serious about a Model Y and called Tesla to set up a test drive.
qfncaf,They didn’t have anything that weekend so I scheduled for the following Saturday.
qfncaf,The sales rep called that afternoon and asked if I wanted to go ahead and put in an order to lock in pricing but I said no I didn’t want to do that without driving one.
qfncaf,Well you know how this goes.
qfncaf,Saturday comes and we drive it and my wife loved it.
qfncaf,"So I go to order and yep, pricing updates hit and this test drive cost me $2k."
qfncaf,"My point, if you have any idea at all that you may order, lock in pricing."
qfncaf,$250 is nothing compared to what you will lose in pricing jumps moving forward.

14jtudl,4Anyone else get ?
7fe0my,Anyone else seeing the obvious smear campaign against Tesla and Elon Musk that is going on through social media and seeping in to mainstream news?
7fe0my,There is an obvious (and paid for) smear/shill campaign against Tesla and Elon Musk by Wallstreet short-sellers and the oil industry.
7fe0my,You can see it in the shill posts and comments around social media where they use the same talking points and use well-documented tactics to sow doubt and the illusion that Tesla is about to go under.
7fe0my,See [this post] (https://np.
7fe0my,reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/31wo57/the_chevron_tapes_video_shows_oil_giant_allegedly/cq5uhse/) about how lobbyists pay PR companies to smear the competition.
7fe0my,"Such talking points I'm seeing constantly being cycled include:  - Tesla unable to scale up production  - Tesla cars catching fire (you can thank the mainstream media for picking up this bullshit story and spreading it)  - Autopilot causing accidents  - Tesla ""making record quarterly losses"" (this one is particularly deceitful because the quarterly losses were forecast and planned due to scaling up production, and these headlines make the reader think they are going under when in fact it is completely normal)  - Tesla workforce issues (most recently that story about racism that was no more than what other large companies deal with on a daily basis)  - Rumours of Elon leaving Tesla (As if he would)  - Sowing doubt about Tesla cars range to spread range anxiety  - General fud about Tesla's financial position  - False assertions that Tesla cars produce more pollution than petrol cars due to electricity production and manufacturing    Elon recently said in an interview that short-sellers have been doing this and have obvious financial incentives to do so."
7fe0my,Given how much money short-sellers have now lost I believe they are going in to overdrive to bring the share price down at this critical juncture with the Model 3 going in to mass production.
7fe0my,We need to make people aware of these efforts so that they don't believe this crap.
1bqvqgv,"My FSD V12.3 beta experience as an infrequent user (Very good)I'm in infrequent user because I don't work very far away, less than 5 miles commute and because FSD would be weird and I'd intervene in one or two key places often."
1bqvqgv,I also go to Florida once a year from New York where I use FSD exclusively on the highways and like 75% of the local driving.
1bqvqgv,I own a Mid range Model 3 early 2019.
1bqvqgv,"So far it's been a massive upgrade, like I can see why Elon is so ""gung ho"" about pushing FSD trials(I still think he's being pushy)."
1bqvqgv,Autopilot/Full Self Driving beta is in a different place now compared to any other version that merely looked and performed like an upgraded version of the last.
1bqvqgv,It's very smooth and very human like.
1bqvqgv,Steering wheel still looks a little robotic on full 90 degree turns but I'd guess it looks fine from outside.
1bqvqgv,"While V11 could take me to work without intervention on some routes I'd rarely let it do that because of pot holes (I live in New York after all) and turning, turning left or right especially sharp turns would get a lot of hesitation from the car."
1bqvqgv,It would never be a danger but it was certainly a strong annoyance because of how long it would take or how much you see the wheel go back and forth.
1bqvqgv,V12 does a significantly better job at this.
1bqvqgv,Very little steering wheel back and forth and the maneuver is performed much faster and smoother.
1bqvqgv,Stop Signs   This is the Achilles heel of FSD V12.
1bqvqgv,It's not great.
1bqvqgv,"V11 was worse, the NHTSA stop is certainly annoying but even after a full stop which I honestly don't mind that much, the car hesitates even when there's no other moving vehicles on the road."
1bqvqgv,From all other stops it accelerates quickly which is great but stop signs gotta be the most cumbersome stops for FSD.
1bqvqgv,"It works and it's gotten a lot better but it is too nice and too hesitant and I dislike that the car stops well before the stop line and sometimes before the stop sign (which are brought forward so the driver sees it sooner, not moving the stop line closer)."
1bqvqgv,Average driving speed is unusually low.
1bqvqgv,This might have been a conscious choice for safety and/or processing of FSD but previous FSD versions kept the set speeds much closer to our goals where as current FSD V12 is closer to speed limit and granny speeds excluding fast accelerations.
1bqvqgv,"All that said the car feels like it's 93% ready (in my unscientific guess) for the ""Supervised Driving Assistant"" that they will be advertising soon."
1bqvqgv,"They need to get better with the stop signs and identifying traffic and moving vehicles for stops signs so the car can move on quicker, stop closer to the point the cars needs to in order to see traffic and improve average driving speed."
e2t2tk,2019.40.1.
e2t2tk,1 being installed right now!
e2t2tk,"Update: Installation done, not a beta, same release notes as 2019.40.1 referenced in that Twitter pic post."
e2t2tk,**Release Notes pic**  http://imgur.com/a/qy4EBIR  Full version info: v10.1 (2019.40.1.
e2t2tk,1 861901a57768)    **Release notes** (via Google lens ocr)  **Automatic Wiper Improvements**        Automatic wipers have been improved to be more likely to activate when it is lightly raining and respond to changes in rain intensity for more environments.
e2t2tk,The automatic wipers are now employing the first production deep neural network trained with over 1 million images for the detection of water droplets on a windshield and additional weather cues.
e2t2tk,"If automatic wipers is not performing to your preference, any manual adjustment to wiper speed will be captured to further train and improve the network in future software updates."
e2t2tk,"To enable automatic wipers, tap the windshield wiper icon located in the ""Cards"" area on the touchscreen and select AUTO."
e2t2tk,**Automatic Lane Change Improvements**     Automatic lane changes have been tuned to make lane changes with more confidence.
e2t2tk,"When the adjacent lane is detected to be open, automatic lane changes will initiate faster and be more assertive."
e2t2tk,"To further increase assertiveness of lane changes, select MAD MAX for SPEED BASED LANE CHANGES by tapping Controls > Autopilot > CUSTOMIZE NAVIGATE ON AUTOPILOT."
e2t2tk,*This release contains minor improvements and bug fixes.
e2t2tk,"*  -----------------  (Pre install finished post text):     I'm not sure if this is an Early Access build or not, but I was surprised to see no mention of this on Google search, TeslaFi, or here!"
e2t2tk,Will update with the release notes as soon as it's done.
e2t2tk,"I've been in Early Access for over a year, and I got pushed from an EA build to regular a few months ago, when Smart Summon hit general release."
e2t2tk,"Im hoping this is an Early Access build, since the next one is supposed to have some more FSD features...."
e2t2tk,Btw some background on getting into Early Access:      I bought FSD with my Model3 LR purchase in June 2018.
e2t2tk,"I've been providing bug reports via voice ""Report bug bla bla"" on autopilot issues very frequently."
e2t2tk,"I recently had a Tesla ""Remote"" tech do some maintenance, and he mentioned he remotely looks at a lot of Autopilot bug reports."
e2t2tk,He confirmed that the bug reports via voice do get remotely looked at.
e2t2tk,He did recommend trying to verbalize such that the text-to-speech looks correct.
e2t2tk,Otherwise they just throw it in the trash.
e2t2tk,He also recommended that the report should be done immediately since there **so much** log data it's a pain to go too far back.
e2t2tk,"For any reports over email, he recommended accurate a timestamp as possible (minute level is good), and a GPS location is nice to have as well."
e2t2tk,"I mentioned I go on Google maps and use Street view to pinpoint the location, and he said that's extremely helpful."
e2t2tk,But he really stressed on getting the timestamp accurate.
e2t2tk,"Oo the car rebooted, can't wait to get screenshots of the release notes!"
e2t2tk,"2nd reboot, 80%, no..."
e2t2tk,30% now.
e2t2tk,"Might've misread it, or it pulled a ""File Explorer copy progress %"" on me."
e2t2tk,3rd reboot!
e2t2tk,!
e2t2tk,Finally complete!
e2t2tk,!

abmxx2,"the test swerveWhen I used to be into road bike racing, I would sometimes swerve toward a line racers to see how they would react and if anyone hits the breaks, I could jump into the space created in front of them when they slow down."
abmxx2,"I have never been so aggressive about taking a lane on the highway, but I've noticed that when I use autopilot to change lanes, it seems to use this tactic of swerving toward the lane it's trying to get into, startling drivers into hitting the brakes and then jumping into the space created when they do."
abmxx2,Is anyone else surprised by how assertive autopilot is when changing lanes?
8y1ngw,"Takeaways from investors meetings with Senior Director of Investor Relations Aaron Chew from TuesdayOn Tuesday, Tesla spoke with large investors on site (and they toured the tent), lead by Senior Director of IR, Aaron Chew."
8y1ngw,I'm piecing together information from different sources (both public and private) and I'll be stealing some quotes from Bank of America Merrill Lynch as they had a nice writeup and opinion of it (noted by block quotes).
8y1ngw,"**Model 3 production**  GA3 was running at 4K a week  GA4 made up the additional 1K (to get to the 5K goal)  They expect GA3 to ramp up to 5K a week and keeping GA4 stagnant at 1K by the end of the month, making 6K a week but realistically running a 5K a week rate sustainably for all of Q3 2018."
8y1ngw,"Q3: 5K/week  ~Q4: 7K/week  ~Mid-2019: 10K/week  > Although TSLA is confident in the sustainability of its production rate, based on its past challenges in ramping up production, we remain somewhat skeptica land believe it will take some time before the Model 3 production reaches material scale."
8y1ngw,**Full Self Driving**  Tesla noted they are not on the same path as other companies when it comes to getting to level 4-5 autonomy.
8y1ngw,"While some companies are open road testing those levels, Tesla is doing their testing behind the scenes."
8y1ngw,"Tesla has cars with level 2-3 (V1) available in the public but are still a bit off from road testing level 4-5 (V2)  >  And while TSLA is currently in development phase of V2.0 AV (entering validation phase), commercialization of the technology is still some ways off, although TSLA will likely launch some mobility model  **China Factory**  Reached agreement to build a factory with planned capacity of 500K."
8y1ngw,"Did not disclose how that was going to be built, when it will be started/finished, and how much it would cost."
8y1ngw,"They did expect it to be funded like capex in the past: funding from cash flows, co-funding with other sources, capex deferrals)."
8y1ngw,"> In our view, this is a prudent move to not only tap into the largest electric vehicle market, but also to mitigate trade risk in light of escalating trade war tensions globally."
8y1ngw,"Also of note, in response to tariffs imposed by the US, China recently raised the tariff on US-manufactured vehicles imported into China to 40%, which forced TSLA to materially raise prices on its vehicles sold in the China market."
8y1ngw,**Capital Raise**  Tesla did re-affirm that they will not require an equity or debt raise this year.
8y1ngw,">  We would note that customers are now required to pay an additional $2,500 to configure the Model 3, which, based on the current reservation count of 420k, could equate to a $1bn cash infusion, and may buy a few quarters before TSLA needs to return to the capital markets."
8y1ngw,"**Merrill Lynch on competition:**  > Although TSLA is trailblazer within the electric vehicle market, we believe competition is heating up from both incumbent players and newer entrants looking to capitalize on the high-growth space."
8y1ngw,"We would highlight planned new vehicle launches (per our Car Wars analysis) from BMW (i platform), Daimler (EQ platform), Audi (e-tron platform), and most notably Porsche (Taycan, Mission E Cross Turismo), as well as an aggressive push from newer China/Asia OEMs such as BYD, Byton, Geely/Polestar/Volvo, and NIO."
8y1ngw,"In addition, some companies may pursue a vertical integration of battery/electric vehicle manufacturing (in the same way as TSLA), with the recent agreement between BMW and CATL being an example."
8y1ngw,"However, it does not yet appear that TSLA perceives these efforts as a major competitive threat, and we would admit the market vacuum still exists for now."
b0pzq5,2019.5.
b0pzq5,"15 NoA seems a good deal better, but still needs workI got a couple chances to try out NoA today on 2019.5."
b0pzq5,15 in my M3 LR RWD w/ EAP.
b0pzq5,Comparison is from 2018.50.6.
b0pzq5,tl;dr it's better but still needs work.
b0pzq5,"My baseline experience was from a test done in early Feb during a 2,600 mile road trip, which was my first extended experience with NoA."
b0pzq5,My conclusion then was that it was seriously lacking in a number of ways.
b0pzq5,"I tried both ""Average"" and ""Mad Max"" settings in a number of different traffic conditions."
b0pzq5,"Unless the action was obviously unsafe, I followed suggestions."
b0pzq5,"I was watching carefully, and attempted to respond to suggestions quickly."
b0pzq5,"Needless to say, this isn't a fully controlled test by any means, but in both cases (before/after) I was attempting to collect, classify, and assess a set of cases."
b0pzq5,"**NoA on 2018.50.6**  * hesitant/not confident in many key cases * frequently was either late or early but rarely on time for lane changes * often notified of upcoming lane change for no apparent reason * often suggested lane changes when a car was approaching from behind * after manually changing lanes then came up behind slow vehicle, waited a long time before suggesting lane change * frequent cancellation of lane change in progress * handled only the most gentle and tame interchanges  **NoA on 2019.5."
b0pzq5,"15**  * Generally more confident and decisive * Most lane change suggestions timing about right * No false upcoming lane change notices * Smarter ""get in the right lane before interchange"" process * Quicker ""return to travel lane after passing"" process * New ""Tap to Delay"" on display notification of upcoming lane change * Still seems to wait for a long time after manual lane change then coming behind slow vehicle * Only one failed lane change due to car approaching from behind, 5 or 6 others ok * Handled several complex interchanges in heavy traffic well, failed completely on one of them  Overall, this seems like a substantial incremental improvement."
b0pzq5,"The ""Tap to Delay"" feature seems like a good idea, and perhaps a way for Tesla to get feedback."
b0pzq5,"In my first test, I had numerous cases where my driving on NoA pissed off people behind; today there was only one case of this."
b0pzq5,Tests were in Boston area in typically heavy mid-day traffic.
b0pzq5,"Based on my 2,600 mile road trip, Boston (and perhaps metro New York) have a *very* high degree of difficulty."
b0pzq5,"Road conditions were dry, but there's still salt on roads, which significantly reduces contrast between road and lane markings."
b0pzq5,"Boston is highly congested, and we drive ..."
b0pzq5,assertively.
b0pzq5,"In one interchange test today (I 95 N onto I 93 S) the NoA system did a good job moving me from the leftmost lane to the rightmost lane over a mile, waiting for good opportunities to suggest changes, and then executing the change crisply."
b0pzq5,"When it got to the off ramp, however it got confused and made several swerves that forced me to take over."
b0pzq5,This is a very hard intersection and traffic was as challenging as it gets.
b0pzq5,Also line markings were hard to see.
b0pzq5,"But this is not a system that can work ""most of the time"" and leave you to pick up in the middle of a tense situation ..."
b0pzq5,"yes, I know that's exactly what the system is now, and I fully accept that, and am only reporting my perceptions and opinion as a driver hoping it will continue to get better -- these kinds of events significantly reduce my confidence in the system, and I suspect less tolerant drivers may feel the same way."
b0pzq5,"The failed/cancelled lane change was a far more basic and common situation: I was in middle lane behind a slower truck that a string of cars were passing, waiting for an opportunity to pass myself."
b0pzq5,"I was impressed that the system recommended a change when there was an opening, and it was fairly quick to act after I confirmed."
b0pzq5,"But it didn't accelerate, and then had to bail out, which was confusing and alarming for me and for the driver behind me."
b0pzq5,"This case seems like a solvable one to me, and perhaps it's on the way but still needs work, IMO."
b0pzq5,"Beyond NoA, it seems like several other functions work a good deal better after the 2019.5."
b0pzq5,"15 update -- less abrupt braking, more smooth response to other cars and conditions that previously resulted in more dramatic/sudden braking, crisper lane changing in general."
b0pzq5,"Overall, I am just happy to see that AP functionality is making progress just as we would expect: several months of new data, presumably."
b0pzq5,Props to the Data Science team at Tesla!
s0gk0m,Tesla 'Full Self-Driving' beta features an 'Assertive' mode with rolling stops | Engadget
1cc51xo,Did the “Follow Distance” Menu Item Move Somewhere Else?
1cc51xo,"Not sure if this is related to my current free trial of FSD, but when I side-clicked on the right thumb wheel today I didn’t see the “follow distance” selector (2 3 or 4 car lengths) that I had seen there previously."
1cc51xo,"Instead, I saw a new screen come up with “autopilot settings” with chill/average/assertive options."
1cc51xo,Did the follow-distance selector move elsewhere or has it been replaced by this new (and more vague) option set?
1bt61bp,FSD drives embarrassingly hesitantEverytime when approaching an intersection.
1bt61bp,Only feel comfortable when there is no car behide me and there is very few traffic...
1bt61bp,Otherwise I just can't stop wondering whether I pissed off the car behind me.

16nx97d,Why isn't Minimal Lane Change the default?
11ap03o,I don’t even have FSD beta turned on and twice I’ve gotten strikes out.
11ap03o,Was from normal autopilot (hand not heavy enough on the wheel).
11ap03o,Is this a thing now?
15iyum7,Is there any money in building a super charger station?
15iyum7,There’s a place I’ve seen for sale that I feel like it would be a good place for charging and have wondered if it could be profitable.
12bi3bx,Rant - FSD 11.3 NHTSA recall is terrible!
12bi3bx,TLDR: NHTSA saying rolling stops isn't allowed because it breaks the law is hypocritical because they allow setting the max speed above the speed limit and both are behaviors most drivers do.
12bi3bx,I'll start by saying I have to go through 7 stop signs to leave/enter my neighborhood and their new requirement that fsd must come to a complete 0 mph stop makes me the 1% of my neighbors that does this instead of a rolling stop at 2-3 mph the other 99% does so I don't use it much in my neighborhood.
12bi3bx,It throws off the timing when others arrive at the intersection after me but beta thinks they need to go first because I haven't fully stopped yet.
12bi3bx,I get they want self driving cars to follow the law exactly but what really annoys me is that I can set the speed offset +30% above the speed limit and that's not just Tesla but every car manufacturer can set cruise control above the speed limit (Volvo can go 125 mph and BlueCruise +20 mph over speed limit).
12bi3bx,I can set my max to 85 mph in a 25 mph zone but god forbid I slow to 2 mph at an intersection!
12bi3bx,NHTSA is fine with speeding which everyone does but not rolling stop which everyone does?
12bi3bx,!
12bi3bx,?
12bi3bx,And I'm not advocating for slowing to 5 mph like they used to have on Assertive profile but 2-3 when no pedestrians are present would be a huge difference and more human-like.
12bi3bx,Just like setting the max above the speed limit can be configured so should this and both should come with a warning that the driver is responsible and can be ticketed.
12bi3bx,"Ok, thanks for reading this far if you did, rant over!"

13p9h9d,Advice dealing with Tesla service?
13p9h9d,Bought my car into Tesla to get my Falcon Wing Doors to get looked it.
13p9h9d,"They had previously hit our garage door when it was open, and also swiped someone's side mirror."
13p9h9d,"We brought it in last Tuesday, and they initial said it'd be done by Wednesday EOD."
13p9h9d,"They then updated it to last Thursday, then updated to Monday this week, now they're saying Thursday of this week (1.5 weeks after initial drop off)."
13p9h9d,"Not a lot more detail from then on what's going on, and very frustrating to have them keep on changing the date."
13p9h9d,Any suggestions on how to deal with Tesla service?
fej0ux,"My Coal-Powered CarThis morning when I finished some shopping (not in my town, but nearby here in central Texas) and came back out to my car, there was a huge SUV (Ford Excursion, maybe?"
fej0ux,") parked next to me, and a white-haired man was with it."
fej0ux,"As I was putting my stuff in the trunk, he made a comment that sounded at first to me like ""That's a cool car, isn't it""?"
fej0ux,which is something I'm fairly used to hearing.
fej0ux,"Then I played it back in my head and realized that it actually sounded more like ""coal""."
fej0ux,"So I asked him, ""Coal-powered car""?"
fej0ux,"Yes, he asserted again that my car is powered by coal."
fej0ux,"So, I told him that where I live there are wind farms going up everywhere."
fej0ux,"He said:  Oh, those!"
fej0ux,"Well you know, those wind turbines don't really work."
fej0ux,"They aren't even turning most of the time, and they're usually broke down or catching on fire."
fej0ux,That was news to me.
fej0ux,"I told him we've had huge wind turbine components trundling through our little town regularly for *years* now, and no end in sight."
fej0ux,It's hard to see how that's possible if wind power isn't working out.
fej0ux,"Then he *explained* to me that the only reason all those wind farms are being built is because of government subsidies, and whenever they do actually manage to produce some power it's wildly expensive."
fej0ux,"I didn't really want to continue that argument, so I shrugged and moved along."
fej0ux,"It did kind of irk me, though."
fej0ux,I don't want to give the impression that this sort of thing happens all the time.
fej0ux,"I've had the Roadster for five years, and this is only maybe the second time that I've ever been roped into a dispute of this sort."
fej0ux,"Where I live the whole ""green"" aspect isn't even on most people's radar; the subject doesn't come up."
fej0ux,"I bought the Roadster because I thought it would be fantastically fun to drive, which I'm happy to say has turned out to be true."
fej0ux,"The next place I stopped after that was the convenience store for a taco, and as I went in I was accosted by a young man who wanted to tell me that my car is cool and beautiful, and for a moment when I pulled in he mistook it for a McLaren."
fej0ux,"So, I got to tell him about the Roadster's background with Lotus."
fej0ux,"THAT is the sort of conversation that I would rather have about my car, and thankfully has been a much more common experience than political arguments."
sw07sf,Lost Free SuperchargingAnyone with 2019 M3LR suddenly lose free supercharging?
sw07sf,I’ve had it since I bought the car and even checked my account online and it said unlimited lifetime supercharging under manage for the car.
sw07sf,Anyone have this happen and get it back through some channels?
1d2k1eu,"FSD Issues and recommended settingsHi folks,  Just got a three month FSD sub and am using it to drive over 75 miles a day on one of the busiest and most crowded commutes in the USA for a couple of weeks."
1d2k1eu,Initial verdict = can get you into an accident.
1d2k1eu,The good: Does very well on the highway except random braking and indecisiveness when switching lanes.
1d2k1eu,I was able to get around this indecisiveness by switching from chill to standard mode.
1d2k1eu,Anyone have any tips for the random braking?
1d2k1eu,"The bad: Delays on side streets and dangerous actions in roundabouts (roundabouts, ive had to take control several times to avoid an accident)."
1d2k1eu,The most common was leaving half of the car in the roundabout lane and abruptly breaking due to an incoming car.
1d2k1eu,Assertive mode does not help and does odd things with lane switching on highways when enabled anyway.
1d2k1eu,Anyone else have issues like this/a fix?
1d2k1eu,"At the moment, If I have anywhere to be at a reasonable time or if don't want enduce heavy road range from the people behind me, FSD is not the play."
1d2k1eu,Note:Been reporting all of these to the feedback mechanism in the car.
1d2k1eu,Thoughts?
16gzaeb,"""Safe"" Following DistanceI've had my 2023 M3 RWD for a few weeks now, put about 860 miles on it and have noticed I get dinged regularly for unsafw following."
16gzaeb,"I throw it onto each of the FSD follow modes (Chill, Average, Assertive) and have noted the distances each follows vehicles on the freeway."
16gzaeb,"I've attempted to mimic the distances with, you know human margin for error, and have consistently been getting ridiculously high percentage unsafe following."
16gzaeb,It's there some magic number I need to lock in to avoid triggering it?
1bxhceu,FSD update Unsolicited updated: Wasn’t that impressed at first but getting more comfortable and it’s beginning to shine.
1bxhceu,Made a 25 min drive feel like 2 mins.
1bxhceu,So much for “what you don’t know can’t hurt you”   Great strategy for Tesla to capture more revenue for basically no additional investment at a time they need it most.

1dqn010,14-50 quoteI’m located in south Texas.

1dqn010,Good quote?
1bah1b0,"Rented a Model Y Long Range to see if it might be for me (long post)Hi Folks,  Just some random experiences to share from an EV shopper, nothing more."
1bah1b0,I've been wanting an EV since before my last car purchase - a new 2015 Subaru Crosstrek Limited - and feel that this year it'll happen.
1bah1b0,"I was resisting Tesla but wanted to give it a fair tryout, primarily due to the pricing and advertised features."
1bah1b0,"I apologize if you disagree with any of my impressions or feel I got things wrong, as this is not meant to troll the sub and instead trying to be just another set of opinions for other shoppers."
1bah1b0,It seemed this was the most appropriate sub in which to post these thoughts.
1bah1b0,Initially went on three 30 minute test drives of 2024 Model Y LR models with the larger tires.
1bah1b0,"That helped me learn how to operate the car, because I feel you do need to learn Tesla-style interfaces, becoming smoother after practicing what you learn and getting deeper into the car's control options."
1bah1b0,"Then I rented a 2023 Model Y LR with 19"" tires through Turo for three days this past week."
1bah1b0,"I wanted to see how it would feel being my daily driver for mundane needs: errands, shopping, commuting, general transportation."
1bah1b0,"It's a big change, going to an EV, and a Tesla is unique compared to other brand models I've tried."
1bah1b0,"So, this was giving it a real-world spin."
1bah1b0,.
1bah1b0,.
1bah1b0,.
1bah1b0,"**Seating**  The Model Y's driver's seat was comfortable enough, with a more heavily molded seating style."
1bah1b0,It had bolstering that kept thighs and lower+upper back relatively centered and secure.
1bah1b0,"I wanted more lumbar adjustment, but it was OK as-is."
1bah1b0,"Unfortunately, it also gave me little room to avoid pressing on a long-term shoulder blade injury and easily triggered my related nerve pain issues."
1bah1b0,So I reclined the seat more than my usual amount and adjusted the steering wheel forward to increase my lean.
1bah1b0,"This took some pressure off my shoulder injury, which helped a bit."
1bah1b0,"In most other EVs I've driven, this wasn't much of a problem because the seats weren't pinning me in place quite so much - I could shift slightly as needed."
1bah1b0,The Tesla felt more like being in a gamer's chair style to me.
1bah1b0,Position adjustments were easily done via standard controls on the side of the seat.
1bah1b0,"I heard that they can be remembered for each person's phone key, which is a great feature if so."
1bah1b0,"Heating was effective and easily controlled, once you learn how to control it in the big display."
1bah1b0,The rear seats were OK with large knee room.
1bah1b0,A bigger+taller guest tried out the rear passenger seat and easily fit without adjustments.
1bah1b0,The ability to recline rear seats seemed a benefit for trying to sleep on trips.
1bah1b0,"That said, the rear seating was also molded style and some passengers felt it was too confining and intrusive for casual resting or just laying back."
1bah1b0,"Everyone complained about the hard, highly forward-leaning headrests."
1bah1b0,Everyone.
1bah1b0,"I learned on YouTube how to take those out and adjust them, if desired, so I don't think they would be a problem."
1bah1b0,**Steering**  The steering wheel is chunky and I generally like that feel.
1bah1b0,But the palm-facing edge is a bit long and did cause fatigue in the thumb creases of my palms after driving for more than 15 minutes at a time.
1bah1b0,"Not terribly, but I would have preferred a more rounded and less contoured shape."
1bah1b0,Standard mode steering is heavy in that there was a great deal of center pull.
1bah1b0,"I eventually settled on Comfort mode, which was a little better for everyday travel in suburban or city driving."
1bah1b0,"Steering wheel adjustments up/down and in/out were easy enough, once you learn how to activate such changes in the big display and related thumbwheels."
1bah1b0,"The steering wheel heating feature is effective and easily adjusted, once you learn how to access it in the big display."
1bah1b0,**Visibility**  By the last day of my rental - and even after three prior test drives - I finally started to feel out boundaries of the car when it came to parking and going around corners.
1bah1b0,"Raising my seat height helped a bit and the built-in camera views were generally helpful, but sometimes misleading."
1bah1b0,"That is, I did find that the graphics on the screen when parking were hit-and-miss, in that warnings were sometimes offered when I still had good clearance next to a curb while pulling in from an angle, etc."
1bah1b0,It was confusing until I learned to ignore the information given and just go by what I saw through windows and cameras.
1bah1b0,"The hood dropoff in front is extreme and I could not see the front end of the car, so learned to estimate where it was by my final day of renting."
1bah1b0,"I generally appreciated the radar-like view of objects around me, it was informative and I caught myself looking there first for nearby cars after awhile, before checking through the rearview mirror or side windows."
1bah1b0,"In general, it provides good information about your surroundings, which was appreciated because the rear window is relatively small and the view through the rearview mirror makes things feel about twice the distance away than things really happen to be."
1bah1b0,Automatic side-view cameras with turning signals is extremely helpful.
1bah1b0,"The side mirrors can be adjusted fine (once you figure out how to activate them in the big display), but they are relatively smaller than I'm used to and again made objects appear smaller+farther away."
1bah1b0,Window visibility was fine except for the small.
1bah1b0,angled rear window.
1bah1b0,"**Styling**  The exterior is contemporary and subtle in how the rear fenders swell, giving it a subtly stylish but somewhat generic look with some inherent heft."
1bah1b0,"Even though it's not a style I personally identify with, it's fine for what it is."
1bah1b0,"The interior styling is has rather spare, contemporary styling, as well."
1bah1b0,"Again, not my style but I learned to ignore it and move on."
1bah1b0,The steering wheel and big center display are your areas of focus in the car.
1bah1b0,"There are subtly marked door lock, door opener and storage opening points, but they are subdued and don't stand out."
1bah1b0,"The left and right stalks are chunky and blend in to the dashboard due to coloring, mostly."
1bah1b0,"Its hatch design gives it something of a ""fat behind"" impression, but it's not oblong."
1bah1b0,"**Ride**  It's a tight suspension, but also unrefined in my view."
1bah1b0,"That is, you can have a tighter performance setup and still be able to lean into turns, follow bumps without losing the back end and generally be fun to drive in both twisty roads while maintaining stability on highway stretches."
1bah1b0,"My Audi A4 (six cylinder) had a nice balance of those characteristics and, strangely enough, my Crosstrek with an STi anti-sway bar kit has a decent combination of different worlds in an unassuming package."
1bah1b0,"The Model Y Long Range on 19"" wheels is a bit more forgiving of uneven road surfaces than the larger wheels, IMHO."
1bah1b0,"Still, they each felt super tight in the suspension, with more feedback through the car body than steering wheel, without actually leaning into or hugging turns that I could feel."
1bah1b0,"Perhaps Tesla is trying for a super-neutral feel, as it did not offer much in the way of feeling out dynamics between the body and suspension through a turn, so I had to control it as if playing a video game - all visual."
1bah1b0,"Road imperfections cause minor bumping and body-accentuated noise at most times, but sometimes led to larger rumbling and changes in cabin air pressure."
1bah1b0,"On that point, I and my passengers experienced noticeable pressure in our ears and sinuses at seemingly random times while riding at least 40MPH, usually in combination with a feeling of rumbling in the cabin and not always when driving on rough pavement."
1bah1b0,"It was as if the rear windows were both open at highway speeds and we were being buffeted by the wind/pressure, but all windows and doors were closed and it wasn't always faster speeds where this condition cropped up."
1bah1b0,"I recall reading somewhere that the above symptoms are known and might be fixed with a hatch adjustment, but don't recall specifics."
1bah1b0,"I did notice that the hatch of this car did not appear perfectly centered in the rear, if that is at all related."
1bah1b0,"The pressure/rumbling symptom led one of my passengers - who can easily get vertigo - to become very nauseous on their one ride of mixed local+highway, plus it led to me getting dizzy with some headache strain during one of my commutes."
1bah1b0,"On the highway, the car has more bumping+rumbling than I expected but is acceptable."
1bah1b0,"As implied above, it doesn't track intuitively for me on turns but is easy enough to manage."
1bah1b0,"I actually had to use more effort than expected to keep it steady in lanes at speed, it kept wanting to make its own path + the steering had that heavy tendency to pull back towards center."
1bah1b0,"Instead of little adjustments to stay  steady in a lane, I had to work against the car's center pull to avoid inner lane wandering - it's not bad, just a different dynamic to learn."
1bah1b0,"Around town, it's a decent car for the suburbs."
1bah1b0,"Turning is not graceful and often feels understeered despite acting oversteered in effect, but it works OK once you get used to the dynamics."
1bah1b0,"We have to learn the ins and outs of driving new cars, this is no different in that regard."
1bah1b0,"There were strange rattles from unexpected places (e.g., windshield visor) when travelling over some bumps at times, I couldn't tell if that was the car or things that the owner left in storage areas for some of them."
1bah1b0,"Sort of funny, I drove my Crosstrek today on the usual work commute and got the sense its ride was comfortable but still responsive (again, I've added a little bit of stability help from the STi model)."
1bah1b0,Then I realized it was because the Model Y felt so much harder in the ride over three days and I was inherently noticing the difference after switching back.
1bah1b0,"I've never thought of my Crosstrek as having a particularly soft ride, just a stable one."
1bah1b0,"**Performance**  So, I've owned and driven faster + torquey ICE cars in the past, but in the later half of my life have decided that I really don't need acceleration or raw power to have a fun, safe or satisfying drive."
1bah1b0,"When younger, I relied too much on having power available, nowadays it's only proactive and assertive defensive driving for me."
1bah1b0,"The Model Y LR in Standard pedal mode can really pull in an instant, so I quickly learned not to do that."
1bah1b0,"Although I became smoother with the car in Standard mode, I found that Chill has a wider range for adjusting your speed and was just easier to be smooth in everyday driving."
1bah1b0,"I like the option to switch, once you figure out how to configure it on the big display."
1bah1b0,"Its regenerative braking feels aggressive and definitely took practice to avoid my usual manner of modulating the accelerator in ICE cars (i.e., I rarely brake until needed, usually adjust my speed and that's where being proactive with nearby traffic comes into play."
1bah1b0,")  It's actually kind of tiring on longer highway stretches to keep the Modely Y pedal constant, because the accelerator modulation I use in ICE cars helps keep speed relatively constant and smooth in accel/decel changes, but also relieves strain in doing so."
1bah1b0,"With the Model Y, any layoff on the pedal will immediately brake - so, you have to keep your foot pressing down at constant pressure the entire stretch of highway."
1bah1b0,"I can see where driving assist features can weigh in here nicely, but it's one feature area that I didn't test."
1bah1b0,"However, I really like its one-pedal operation for traffic, slower roads and suburbs or cities."
1bah1b0,"You can drive very smoothly in stop-and-go driving with the single pedal, it was a very good experience in the Tesla and really highlighted a driving experience benefit of its regen braking setup, IMHO."
1bah1b0,"**Economy and Charging**  My home charger isn't setup yet - I haven't finalized my first EV choice yet, so am installing a Tesla Universal wall unit that has the best of both connector worlds."
1bah1b0,"And it was raining heavily for the first two days of my rental, so I didn't want to use an external charger in those conditions if not needed."
1bah1b0,"I visited a Supercharger site on the final day, so that I could return the car with a reasonable amount of charge."
1bah1b0,"I couldn't figure out where to add a charging stop in the Tesla mobile app's navigation UI, so planned my trip through the car's big display interface."
1bah1b0,It was easy enough to figure out on my own (after a few tries) and it gave me confidence in showing what to expect as I got closer to my chosen charger site.
1bah1b0,Seeing the battery preconditioning message when I was closer to the charging location offered even  more confidence in Tesla knowing what they were doing.
1bah1b0,"When I arrived at the Supercharger location, which was next to a hotel, two other cars were in place with plenty of other spaces available."
1bah1b0,"I backed into the stall at one end, used the Tesla app to open the port door (even though I know you can do that with the charger handle), pulled out the charger cable and connected."
1bah1b0,"Blue blinking led to yellow blinking (actually green, is my understanding - I'm colorblind) and then it started charging in earnest."
1bah1b0,"I set the max to 80% in the app and by the time I was back in the car, it was already charging at 140kW."
1bah1b0,"We hear so much about Tesla's charging infrastructure advantage and it's real, IMHO: but that extends to their navigation with trip planning, battery preconditioning, car + Supercharger handshakes, car/app display of status and even integration with your account for payment."
1bah1b0,"That's a lot of integration points and Tesla manages it very well, IMHO."
1bah1b0,"I just chilled in the car by exploring more features in the big display, made a couple phone calls and then it was just about done."
1bah1b0,"30 minutes to go from \~30-80% charge, nice and easy."
1bah1b0,"Sort of expensive, but still less than gasoline for the same range while also relaxing, with no fumes, etc."
1bah1b0,"Waiting for your charge is not a bad thing, people could learn to appreciate relaxing at points during a drive, IMHO."
1bah1b0,"Other Teslas had arrived by the time I left, it was like a little social club where everyone was together, but nobody was talking and instead looking at their own phones - like my kids with their friends."
1bah1b0,"**Usability and feel**  If aliens came to Earth and someone described a passenger automobile to them, well, that's what the Model Y feels like."
1bah1b0,"The interface requires some learning if you only know traditional ICE interfaces and I purposefully repeated ""once you figure out how to X on the big display"" above because that's the reality of driving this car: all status information and most controls are through that single display."
1bah1b0,"It's a sea change and you can get used to it, but it takes practice to get muscle memory down and not impact your safety if changes are needed while on the road."
1bah1b0,"I definitely recommend going through the UI before driving, especially looking for common things you would use before getting on the road (e.g., climate controls, audio, phone, etc."
1bah1b0,")  The app's ability to control the car, plan trips, obtain service, buy things, etc."
1bah1b0,is impressive - they did a very nice job there.
1bah1b0,"I've heard its better than for other brands and can see why, if that's truly the case."
1bah1b0,"I got used to controlling the car's features, checking status and all while in the house or office, it was natural."
1bah1b0,"Inside the car, adjusting controls by point and click is funny - you select something, such as side mirrors - in the UI and then use the common control wheels in the steering wheel to change their values."
1bah1b0,"That's the most generic interface possible and less direct than manual controls, but it works consistently."
1bah1b0,The ability to place your own function choices on the bottom row of the top screen is a good idea and can mitigate issues with navigating through levels of clicks in the display to adjust on the fly.
1bah1b0,"At the end of the day, you can learn to drive and control this car through a big, central display."
1bah1b0,It works.
1bah1b0,"But it's not ideal, I feel: combining status and controls away from the center of the driver's view is unintuitive and seems more about cost-cutting than anything else."
1bah1b0,It would seem far more usable for status to remain in front of the driver and controls to stay in the big display to the driver's side.
1bah1b0,"Tesla's UI does a reasonably good job of changing view modes up, so that you can see what you need either authomatically (based on the driving situation) or after some clicks and swipes, but it's still a busy UI that combines status and controls into a single space that's off to the side."
1bah1b0,"I didn't like that model in daily use, but was able to use it well enough."
1bah1b0,"Using the larger font helped, because I'm far-sighted and the regular font size was very difficult to read."
1bah1b0,"Unfortunately, my neck began to hurt on the second day with the Model Y because of turning my head to the right so regularly (i.e., it impacts some existing nerve damage) - if status information was directly in front, that would not have been triggered."
1bah1b0,"The ""radar""-like view and side cameras while turning, quick option to see all or some cameras, etc."
1bah1b0,made awareness around me relatively easy without looking through windows.
1bah1b0,"It felt like a safety issue to keep looking at a display instead of through the usual windows, but I learned to trust the cameras a bit more after feeling out what each view represented."
1bah1b0,"There are limits to camera-only viewing, especially while parking, so I learned to use it as a supplemental view in most cases."
1bah1b0,"This car is not very graceful, but changing the pedal and steering wheel modes made it easier to drive in my style."
1bah1b0,"I wanted an ultra-comfort steering mode, but oh well."
1bah1b0,The turn signal stalk pissed me off more than anything else in the car!
1bah1b0,I like a light-to-medium weight stalk feel and do signal quite often during any given drive.
1bah1b0,"Most ICE cars have such a feel, as well as other EVs I've driven."
1bah1b0,"In the Model Y, if you press the stalk up/down with medium pressure, the signal goes off after three blinks (at least with its standard setting) - I almost never use only three blinks, because I signal well before actually turning."
1bah1b0,"So, you need to put more force and a longer throw into the turning stalk for the signal to be enabled in constant mode - that required far more pressure than I have ever used in a car (and trucks!"
1bah1b0,") before, it was entirely distracting for me."
1bah1b0,"And I've had arthritis for decades, so it actually caused discomfort by the end of the day."
1bah1b0,The turning stalk was the only part of the car that I felt truly sucked.
1bah1b0,"Well, auto wiper mode too, but I used the manual speeds just fine."
1bah1b0,I didn't realize there was a glove compartment until after accidentally finding its control in the UI.
1bah1b0,Maybe that's for valet-like security reasons?
1bah1b0,"Perhaps they consider the center armrest storage area to be your everyday needs area, with the glove compartment for less frequently-used items."
1bah1b0,"Still, the center storage areas were too open-ended and needed organizers."
1bah1b0,"The phone wireless charger area barely fit my Google Pixel 8 Pro with Otterbox Defender case, it was a super tight fit."
1bah1b0,So I put my phone sideways over the charging spots and it threatened to fall off at times.
1bah1b0,"The rear hatch did not close properly on two occassions, I had to push down to make it latch."
1bah1b0,"Opening doors with a button press is interesting and I tried to press a nonexistent button in an ICE car after dropping off the Tesla, realizing how quickly I got used to it."
1bah1b0,"The outer door handles were likely flush for aerodynamic reasons, so I can't complain about their two-step design for opening a door."
1bah1b0,**Sales experience**  I was entirely misled on pricing by a Tesla Sales Rep who called me after my second test drive.
1bah1b0,"He offered a discount on the price of a configuration we discussed and I asked if that was out-the-door pricing - he said yes, twice."
1bah1b0,"Turns out he lied or was not understanding, because when I visited the link he sent for my target car build, it included $3600 off for an estimated $1200/year savings over three years against gas prices - but that was not off the purchase price."
1bah1b0,"This turned out to be a standard Tesla marketing tactic to grab eyeballs, but he said in the call that it represented a ""discount"" that applied to out-the-door pricing when we talked and I had no visuals in front of me as a reference at the time."
1bah1b0,"So, I told them that it really made me lose trust in Tesla's ability to make a deal, then he went onto autopilot by asking when we would make the sale happen over the next two weeks, until I complained to him about being tone-deaf and reading from a script."
1bah1b0,"Then I provided very clear, negative feedback about that sales experience to Tesla from a survey request they sent me."
1bah1b0,He actually apologized a week later and then went back into autopilot sales mode.
1bah1b0,"I've since been browsing inventory on my own, bypassing the Reps."
1bah1b0,"Their representation of that anticipated gas price savings has since changed in their marketing, it's now more obvious."
1bah1b0,"Kind of a coincidence, maybe other people have complained, too."
1bah1b0,"**TLDR**  * I'm still shopping for my first EV, the Model Y is at a reasonable price-point that it couldn't be ignored."
1bah1b0,"* Impressive technology, great use of it for enabling driver awareness of their surroundings."
1bah1b0,"* Top-notch navigation and charging experiences, which are also nicely integrated."
1bah1b0,"* Tesla requires learning their different driving and controls experience, but you can get the basics down easily and refine your skills over time."
1bah1b0,It doesn't stop you from driving the car on Day 1.
1bah1b0,* Lack of separating status from controls in the UI seems not ideal and caused physical issues for me.
1bah1b0,"* Physical comfort (for me) is on the negative side, but not extremely so."
1bah1b0,"* The car has an unrefined, hard ride but is sort of acceptable."
1bah1b0,"* Usability has pluses and minuses, almost equally so."
1bah1b0,"* Marketing and sales experience was sour, but I found going on your own bypasses the bs - their online buying experience is very smooth."
1bah1b0,"* Pricing reflects that this is a premium EV, mostly due to the strong tech and charging network."
1bah1b0,Other aspects don't feel consistently premium and need further refinement - perhaps that's what Juniper will start to offer.
1bah1b0,"* It's not the top of my EV choice list, but may be a backup option due to pricing."
9upkqe,"Regarding Autopilot “assertiveness”I remember watching a Mobileye presentation where the speaker, an esteemed researcher in the autonomous driving field, talked about an “assertiveness” factor when it comes to self-driving cars."
9upkqe,"Take a taxi driver, for example, when they are able to time and drive themselves quickly for lane changes."
9upkqe,"In socially accepted places, you would say they are being assertive and the aggressiveness is forgiven and not considered rude as they are simply asserting their urgency given the situation."
9upkqe,"Their directional movements have cue, giving clues to the direction they wish to take and other drivers around them are able to flow with it."
9upkqe,Take the other opposite where you have a hesitant driver and their indicisiveness is more annoying and disruptive to the flow of traffic.
9upkqe,You can’t tell what decision they will take.
9upkqe,Assertiveness does not mean aggressive or rude.
9upkqe,"It’s the skill to cue intent, time movements, decide space, predict position, and assert or make space."
9upkqe,It’s clear that Tesla’s AP or any AP has no notion of assertiveness.
9upkqe,It follows blind rules and follows its pacing indifferent to cars around it.
9upkqe,If it were a human driver we’d call it clueless or rather cue-less.
9upkqe,What would it take to program assertiveness into AP?
9upkqe,"(If anyone has seen that talk, please post the link."
9upkqe,")  Edit: if I may add, technology is  nowhere near the ability to have assertiveness."
9upkqe,Humans can predict.
9upkqe,We can see if other drivers are looking at us or if they are looking at all.
9upkqe,We can see the subtle directional cues of other cars by how their wheels are turned or by the slight change in angle of the car preparing to change lanes.
9upkqe,We respond to dozens or hundreds of cues going on around us constantly.
9upkqe,"Treat AP as an augmentation assistant, not Automation."
1bikbws,"My review of the V12, non social media influencer, rarely talks about good things about FSD in this sub."

1bikbws,"Second stop sign now, same thing!"
1bikbws,Wtf.
1bikbws,Accelerator pedal.
1bikbws,Let's go car!
1bikbws,"Ok it's picking up speed, FAST."
1bikbws,"I like it, but I can see how some people won't like this."
1bikbws,(Fast forward past another stop sign).
1bikbws,"Ok speed limit is 50, everyone else going 60, why is this thing going 43."
1bikbws,Seriously did they use my grandma as training data?
1bikbws,"Intervention, accelerator pedals pressed."
1bikbws,Ok here comes that left turn with an immediate merge after the left.
1bikbws,I always have to disengage here.
1bikbws,It...
1bikbws,did it perfectly?
1bikbws,Uhh...
1bikbws,how?
1bikbws,Was that just luck?
1bikbws,Further testing is needed.
1bikbws,Why is it going so slow?
1bikbws,Omg they need to stop using my grandma as training data!
1bikbws,(As I continue down the road I realized I can change my settings.
1bikbws,"Set it to ""assertive"")  Car immediately speeds up, starts changing lanes the way I would do it exactly."
1bikbws,WOW.
1bikbws,Now this car drives exactly like I would.
1bikbws,Can't believe all it took was setting it from normal to assertive.
1bikbws,"Here comes a right turn lane that the car always turns into in the middle of an intersection, I always have to disengage here."
1bikbws,Wait...
1bikbws,is this doing it correctly?
1bikbws,Wow.
1bikbws,No way.
1bikbws,Did they happen to update the maps too or is this V12?
1bikbws,Did it just go into this roundabout that doesn't have any traffic without stopping?
1bikbws,About damn time it's doing it right!
1bikbws,Wow it just made this protected right turn without stopping?
1bikbws,What's going on?
1bikbws,Is someone remotely driving my car?
1bikbws,Arrived.
1bikbws,Wow.
1bikbws,"Other than the grandma driving, ZERO disengagements!"
1bikbws,Went through construction and all the other failure parts I've had before with no issues.
1bikbws,"Grandma driving may have been cause by my settings, so more testing is needed for that leg of the trip, but V12 **may** make me a believer once again."
1bikbws,"We'll see, V11 was amazing at the start too until it degraded into a pile of shit."
1bikbws,We'll see if future version of V12 is any better.
1bikbws,I am cautiously hopeful once again.
qg65dl,"Poor FSD Beta performance, am I the only one?"
qg65dl,"I'm not going to lie, I was super excited to get to finally try the FSD Beta to see what progress had been made through these years of waiting."
qg65dl,When I finally got the build pushed to my car I took it for a daily commute to the gym.
qg65dl,Here's how it went.
qg65dl,The profile is on Assertive btw.
qg65dl,Driving through the neighborhood I understand it treats it as any other road but the car travels literally in the middle of the road so I have to disable it until I get out of neighborhood.
qg65dl,"Turning out of neighborhood the creep is so slow and when it finally decides to go after sitting for a little while with no cars coming, it's just too slow."
qg65dl,"Here's where I was pretty impressed at the 4 way stop sign, it does really well at detected when it's turn is but again it's commitment to go is just way to slow so I find myself always on the acceleration pedal to speed it along before someone honks at me."
qg65dl,"When entering a 2 lane left turn, it chose the one on the very left and what shocked me was it committed too hard and fast this time yanking me into the furthest lane."
qg65dl,It then failed to correctly make the turn though.
qg65dl,It also failed to make the turn at the light to my gym but that turn is a bit hard because of how sharp it is.
qg65dl,I drive this commute every single day so I hope to see FSD grow enough to where I can actually babysit it and not intervene every second.
qg65dl,I just wanted to share my experience with it and a bit of my disappointment as I've had FSD for around 3 years now.

fxwo3w,"Discounted new vehicle is claiming to be as-is**It's a long one, from a new owner."
fxwo3w,I'll try to make it at least interesting to read.
fxwo3w,"**  **TL;DR:**  I bought a new M3 LRAWD from Tesla with 1800mi on it, with a small discount off the list price, and they're trying to tell me that my new vehicle is as-is and the few material and workmanship defects I've found so far, such as as broken stitching and glued surfaces separating on the rear seats, are ""accounted for"" in the discount that was shown on the new vehicle listing."
fxwo3w,Looking for advice is anyone else got this kind of runaround.
fxwo3w,Hi Teslites!
fxwo3w,I took delivery of my new 2020 M3 about 2 weeks ago.
fxwo3w,"I chose it from the new vehicles page from Tesla rather than going through the order process since I needed a replacement vehicle asap because the insurance company totaled my current ICE vehicle (Honda Fit, 10+ years 150K mi) because the transmission died after hitting a very deep pothole."
fxwo3w,"I had been on the Tesla bandwagon from go, dying to own one ever since driving a Model S rental from Enterprise Exotics out in Vegas, but having a solid vehicle with no previous history of mechanical failure made it an expense I didn't really want to take on unless I had to."
fxwo3w,Enter serendipity.
fxwo3w,I ordered a M3 LR AWD in Black with FSD from the new vehicles page and it was being transported from VA.
fxwo3w,"Since I was give the option and I wasn't sure about FSD yet, I had them remove it prior to delivery."
fxwo3w,The vehicle had 1800 miles on it and I was told it was used as part of a dealer's fleet but it was still a new vehicle with all the same warranties.
fxwo3w,"Things didn't start off too swift the communications, I filled out all the paperwork on my side,applied for the financing via the site, and just had one modification that needed to be made to the down payment since some of it was coming from my insurance company through a special rider I had on he policy for vehicle purchase assistance (for totaled cars)   I got a runaround from the dealer saying they can't change anything on the financing, so I asked for contact info for the underwriting bank, and they said there is none and it's all 'automatic' through the website."
fxwo3w,"After a few e-mails that had to be ""escalated"" they managed to update down payment so I completed everything and waited for a delivery appt."
fxwo3w,"Got a call a few days later saying it got in earlier than expected, so set up an appt to go pick it up, return a rental, etc."
fxwo3w,and I felt it was a little bit off that they insisted I complete the paperwork in the showroom prior to even seeing the vehicle.
fxwo3w,"It was a new car, so I told that shoulder-devil to shut up and stop worrying."
fxwo3w,"It honestly didn't even occur to me to look at it prior doing the paperwork, after all I never asked pizza hut to show me the pizza before I paid them."
fxwo3w,"So everything done, my soul was being shipped off to be encumbered by the bank and they took me out to see the car."
fxwo3w,"First thing I noticed, a knuckle length gouge on the rim."
fxwo3w,"There were some minor scuffs on the rear fender, which I didn't care much about because I'd probably scuff it on the first wash anyway."
fxwo3w,"When I asked about the rim, (Mind, this was AFTER they had me sign all the paperwork) they said that was ""accounted for in the discounted price""  and I told them I can't accept it like that and after some of the 'let me talk to my manager' nonsense, they said they'd escalate it."
fxwo3w,"I trusted them, and..."
fxwo3w,at this point I was stranded with no car without getting another rental.
fxwo3w,"Well, I never got any communication from them until I contacted them again, and after sending off an e-mail to the delivery team, I didn't get any reply, but two days later a service center near me txt'd me and said they got the parts in and I had to ask them what parts?"
fxwo3w,"They sent a new rim to the service center, so I got an appt together for that and to install a homelink, which, for some reason tesla shipped directly to me from the Tesla store (along with ordering the home connector) instead of the service center, which the service center said was 'really weird, but who knows!"
fxwo3w,"'  So, everything is good for the time being, it's a blast to drive, nothing beats going flatout on an empty freeway to pass 18 wheelers at light speed, range is great, and I took it for my daily commute and 1 trip and have about 800 miles on it in 2 weeks."
fxwo3w,"Then I took my wife's family for an inaugural drive and one of the buckles on the rear seat wouldn't latch at all, nothing stuck in the buckle, just would not click."
fxwo3w,"So, setup another service appt."
fxwo3w,"Some TXTs later, they said they won't have the part in time for the appt, so they'd set it up for a mobile install later."
fxwo3w,NBD.
fxwo3w,"Next day I was sweeping out and putting in some new floor mats and noticed what looked like water damaged (p)leather on the rear seats, glue that was separating from the plastic shroud and what looked like a broken stitch."
fxwo3w,This is the same seat that had the broken buckle.
fxwo3w,Now I'm strongly suspecting this new 'dealer fleet' vehicle was used with an improperly installed car seat for it's first 1800 miles of life.
fxwo3w,"SIDEBAR: someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I assume cars returned under the 7 day/1000mi policy can't be resold as brand new, at least not without some kind of disclosure, right?"
fxwo3w,Since the vehicles would have to have been titled at least once previously.
fxwo3w,Now the song and dance begins with me adding the new concerns to the mobile appt.
fxwo3w,"which I was fairly certain that they wouldn't be able to fix mobile, but I wanted it recorded at least."
fxwo3w,After adding that and the pictures.
fxwo3w,Another problem shows up.
fxwo3w,I dropped and managed to kick my wallet under the car when I was getting ready to leave.
fxwo3w,"so in fetching it, I notice a big spot, about the size of an oreo, but the creme filling part, because it was white,   on the bottom of the front bumper."
fxwo3w,"I inspected it and it looks like it was a strike or impact, but, it was very smoothly sanded like it was being prepped for paint but never painted."
fxwo3w,"It should go without saying, I didn't strike anything, never bottomed out, and it's just about invisible when doing a normal walk around."
fxwo3w,"I had scheduled an appointment a few weeks from now to have the PPF installed on the whole front end, but this wasn't acceptable."
fxwo3w,"Service center send me a text saying for the seat and the spot, I had to reach out to the delivery team because *NEITHER* of them was a warranty service issue."
fxwo3w,"Now, if the spot was my fault, I'd understand that, but the seat?"
fxwo3w,Separating glued surfaces and broken stitching isn't a defect in workmanship?
fxwo3w,"So, I get in touch with delivery and here's their response:  Hi livingthepuglife,  I was passed along an email from TheDude in regards to your vehicle."
fxwo3w,During your delivery appointment we went over your vehicle extensively.
fxwo3w,"I also informed you that you were purchasing a vehicle with a price adjustment, and went over what that meant."
fxwo3w,Vehicles with price adjustments are sold as is.
fxwo3w,The adjustment on the vehicle accounts for any wear and mileage the vehicle has.
fxwo3w,"Tesla’s are sold with the pricing that you see online, any price adjustment on top of this is to account for mileage and wear."
fxwo3w,"In terms of fitment of the panels, our service team can check them for fitment."
fxwo3w,"If they are outside of specification, they of course, will be adjusted properly for you."
fxwo3w,Please let me know if there are any questions you have going forward.
fxwo3w,"Kind Regards,  Guy with an inadvertently funny name  **|  Operations Manager**  He also included the scanned copy of the delivery form, which he had attached with a kind of unearned confidence that it vindicated his answer (it didn't."
fxwo3w,It's literally the part of the paperwork that says I'm taking the vehicle.
fxwo3w,"There is no implicit or explicit language about condition or warranties)  So, I had to play the part of a simple country lawyer and review every piece of paper and e-mail that I got from Tesla, the original listing, the warranty (both new and used warranty since now I was concerned that I somehow bought a used car, which would be problematic for my insurance company and the settlement I got from them since I was required to buy a new vehicle) and I guess to no one's surprise, there's no language in any tesla warranty or document about discounts or as-is, because in all reality, I'm about 80% confident there's no such thing as an as-is New car."
fxwo3w,"There was also no documentation that had my signature that had any inspection report, list of defects etc."
fxwo3w,"And when I asked in my first reply, the guy completely ignores my request and tries to restate the same thing he said before about discounted vehicles being sold as-is."
fxwo3w,"I check google, I can't find anyone, anywhere using this kind of terminology in regard to tesla, or even new cars in general."
fxwo3w,"There were some back and forths so far, and this guy with the inadvertently funny name wants to stand hard and fast on his assertion above and before I have to put my foot in my mouth maybe someone can tell me:  **IS THIS A THING?"
fxwo3w,**  Has anyone else been told this on a new vehicle or a new vehicle from the listings on the tesla website?
fxwo3w,"With me keeping in mind, he tried to pull this same assertion on a damaged rim, and now I'm seriously concerned about the service I'm going to receive in the future."
fxwo3w,"Although the service team has been actually good so far, and all the mouth sewage seems to be coming from the delivery team or operations manager."
fxwo3w,"I'm now past the ""return period"" so I can't tell them to stuff it and order a new one, the discount on the list price on the website wouldn't have even covered the cost to replace gouged rim if I was doing it out of pocket."
fxwo3w,(Based off the SC's written estimate after they fixed it under warranty)

1bxz92a,"I enjoyed the traffic aware cruise more than FSD because it didn't keep bugging me with wheel shake requests even if I had to remember to stay in the lanes myself, it kept distance from other cars still fine."
1bxz92a,"Maybe a bit more conservative than I'd have been even on full assertive, but acceptable."
1bxz92a,First part had a few congested spots and FSD shines in that.

17smku5,European Tesla Owners Deserve a Full Refund for FSDThe topic I'm bringing to our community today is straightforward: All European Tesla owners who purchased Full Self-Driving (FSD) should be entitled to a full refund.
17smku5,Here’s why:  1.
17smku5,**Unfulfilled Promises**: The core of the issue is simple – the FSD feature has not lived up to the expectations set by Tesla.
17smku5,"In Europe, the functionality is extremely limited, if not entirely non-existent."
17smku5,2.
17smku5,**Regulatory Challenges**: European road regulations vary significantly and are often stricter compared to other regions.
17smku5,"This has severely hindered the capabilities of FSD, making its promised features more of a concept than a reality for us."
17smku5,3.
17smku5,**Financial Fairness**: The cost of FSD is substantial.
17smku5,"We’ve invested in a feature that, as it stands, we can’t fully use."
17smku5,"In any other situation, paying for a service or product that can’t be used as advertised would naturally lead to a refund."
17smku5,4.
17smku5,**A Call for Collective Action**: This isn’t just an individual concern but a collective issue for all European Tesla owners.
17smku5,It's crucial that we come together to voice this need for a refund clearly and assertively.
17smku5,5.
17smku5,**Holding Tesla Accountable**: It’s time for Tesla to acknowledge the limitations of FSD in Europe and offer a fair solution – a full refund to those who purchased it.
17smku5,This is about maintaining trust and integrity in consumer relations.
17smku5,"Until Full Self-Driving is fully realized and operational in Europe, Tesla should offer compensation to all affected customers."
17smku5,A fair and immediate way to do this would be to provide free Supercharging for their vehicles.
17smku5,"This gesture of goodwill would not only acknowledge the delay in delivering the promised FSD capabilities but also provide tangible, immediate benefits to Tesla owners, maintaining a positive relationship while we await the full implementation of FSD."

1c14392,Why does FSD keep merging onto the right lane when there is a left turn up ahead?
1c14392,Is it cause its the slower lane?
1cgfbm3,"As a new Tesla owner, dang FSD is a major let down in it's current stateYou'd think highway driving would be easier for the system to interpret but holy shit."
1cgfbm3,Literally every time I creep up on a car going slow I just get stuck behind it without attempting to pass (yes I have the setting enabled to pass more frequently).
1cgfbm3,"In addition to that, each time that happens and the car is turning it's the same thing."
1cgfbm3,Like what the hell is so hard about this?
1cgfbm3,If I wanted adaptive cruise control I'd buy a fucking Prius.

1biqcqu,I'm really not liking 12.3I tried FSD 12.3 on my 2019 m3 on my 1:15 long commute this morning and I have to say I'm disappointed.
1biqcqu,I should of known when it split the left turn lane right after coming out of my neighborhood.
1biqcqu,Then throughout the whole drive it stayed 10 mph below the max speed set even when I would try and off set more.
1biqcqu,"If I used the accelerator to get it up to the set limit it would stay for a second, then slowly drift back down to 10 under."
1biqcqu,This happened with or without cars around.
1biqcqu,"On multiple occasions it would cut corners too tight, hitting the noise makers and getting way to close to on coming traffic for my liking."
1biqcqu,On straight roads it would slowly ping pong from inside or outside of the lane like it wasn't fully dampened.
1biqcqu,"In stop and go traffic, it would not move all they way up to the car in front of me leaving a large space causing me to get cut off multiple times."
1biqcqu,Overall I'm unhappy.
1biqcqu,FSD 11 wasn't perfect but I could get it to do nearly my whole commute with much less infuriation.
1biqcqu,"The only thing that 12.3 does better is acceleration after a stop sign, which 11 lagged."
1290pru,"PSA, the turn navigate on autopilot off for FSD 11."
1290pru,x.
1290pru,"x is the right thumb wheelI am in the middle of a ~2k mile Road trip and just upgraded to FSD 11, and I noticed I couldn’t turn the “navigate in auto pilot off” (I’ll do this when it suddenly keeps nagging to switch lanes when it doesn’t need to, or will need to get right back because of slower traffic)  The blue “navigate button” is gone, but not the right thumb wheel left/right changes the level of assertiveness, and there is a button to “change lanes less”  All that being said with ~100 miles under my belt on FSD 11 I don’t think it’s (the button to turn off “navigate in auto pilot”) nearly as necessary as it was."
1290pru,"V11 seems much better at only really changing lanes when needed, far less aggressive when it comes to getting out of the far left lane."
1370pu4,Is there any benefit of getting a LR Model 3 over LR Model Y?
1370pu4,I was watching some videos and the overall price of the LR Model Y is slightly less expensive than the LR Model 3.
1370pu4,I test drove both but I feel like I have full control with 3 but the Y feels more roomier and comfier.
1370pu4,What are some other considerations to take into account between both vehicles prior to purchasing one of them?

fxye2h,"I inspected it and it looks like it was a strike or impact, but, it was very smoothly sanded like it was being prepped for paint but never painted."
fxye2h,"It should go without saying, I didn't strike anything, never bottomed out, and it's just about invisible when doing a normal walk around."
fxye2h,"I had scheduled an appointment a few weeks from now to have the PPF installed on the whole front end, but this wasn't acceptable."
fxye2h,"Service center send me a text saying for the seat and the spot, I had to reach out to the delivery team because *NEITHER* of them was a warranty service issue."
fxye2h,"Now, if the spot was my fault, I'd understand that, but the seat?"
fxye2h,Separating glued surfaces and broken stitching isn't a defect in workmanship?
fxye2h,"So, I get in touch with delivery and here's their response:  Hi livingthepuglife,  I was passed along an email from TheDude in regards to your vehicle."
fxye2h,During your delivery appointment we went over your vehicle extensively.
fxye2h,"I also informed you that you were purchasing a vehicle with a price adjustment, and went over what that meant."
fxye2h,Vehicles with price adjustments are sold as is.
fxye2h,The adjustment on the vehicle accounts for any wear and mileage the vehicle has.
fxye2h,"Tesla’s are sold with the pricing that you see online, any price adjustment on top of this is to account for mileage and wear."
fxye2h,"In terms of fitment of the panels, our service team can check them for fitment."
fxye2h,"If they are outside of specification, they of course, will be adjusted properly for you."
fxye2h,Please let me know if there are any questions you have going forward.
fxye2h,"Kind Regards,  Guy with an inadvertently funny name  |  **Operations Manager**  He also included the scanned copy of the delivery form, which he had attached with a kind of unearned confidence that it vindicated his answer (it didn't."
fxye2h,It's literally the part of the paperwork that says I'm taking the vehicle.
fxye2h,"There is no implicit or explicit language about condition or warranties)  So, I had to play the part of a simple country lawyer and review every piece of paper and e-mail that I got from Tesla, the original listing, the warranty (both new and used warranty since now I was concerned that I somehow bought a used car, which would be problematic for my insurance company and the settlement I got from them since I was required to buy a new vehicle) and I guess to no one's surprise, there's no language in any tesla warranty or document about discounts or as-is, because in all reality, I'm about 80% confident there's no such thing as an as-is New car."
fxye2h,"There was also no documentation that had my signature that had any inspection report, list of defects etc."
fxye2h,"And when I asked in my first reply, the guy completely ignores my request and tries to restate the same thing he said before about discounted vehicles being sold as-is."
fxye2h,"I check google, I can't find anyone, anywhere using this kind of terminology in regard to tesla, or even new cars in general."
fxye2h,"There were some back and forths so far, and this guy with the inadvertently funny name wants to stand hard and fast on his assertion above and before I have to put my foot in my mouth maybe someone can tell me:  **IS THIS A THING?"
fxye2h,**  Has anyone else been told this on a new vehicle or a new vehicle from the listings on the tesla website?
fxye2h,"With me keeping in mind, he tried to pull this same assertion on a damaged rim, and now I'm seriously concerned about the service I'm going to receive in the future."
fxye2h,"Although the service team has been actually good so far, and all the mouth sewage seems to be coming from the delivery team or operations manager."
fxye2h,"I'm now past the ""return period"" so I can't tell them to stuff it and order a new one, the discount on the list price on the website wouldn't have even covered the cost to replace gouged rim if I was doing it out of pocket."
fxye2h,(Based off the SC's written estimate after they fixed it under warranty)
1c5i8iw,FSD auto max Anyone know how to slow down when FSD is engaged and it’s in auto /max?
1c5i8iw,You can speed up by pressing the accelerator but I need to kick it out of FSD to slow down and it’s annoying .
1bvcosh,"Please put FSD version to your commentsGuys, I am reading lots of FSD comments but the mode (chill, average, assertive) and version are very important parameters."
1bvcosh,"So, v12.3 chill mode is not very good for LA traffic but I tried v12.3 assertive mode today and it was amazing."
1bvcosh,I tested in rush hour traffic and only once I had to push accelarator pedal to prevent slowing the traffic unnecessarily.
1bvcosh,"At that moment, there was a huge semi trying to turn right into a street with a bit wide turning angle  and my car thought the semi would switch lanes."
1bvcosh,"So if you didn't try all modes, please do so."
1bvcosh,"I also appreciate the tech this car does all this with cameras, it is amazing."
1bvcosh,"Plus, this is not a driverless technology, this is an assistive technology with limited ecpectations."
1bvcosh,So it is better than my expectation.
1bvcosh,Congrats to the Tesla team.
16j0un1,WhyNot my car btw.
16j0un1,Just happened to see it while driving by.
vtfz83,"Back seat rattle/noises over bumpsWhen I picked up my car early June after inspection I noticed noises/rattles from somewhere in the back beats area of the passenger side when I got over any minor, or major bump on the road."
vtfz83,On smooth roads I have no issues with noises.
vtfz83,Could be door at this point..
vtfz83,I took it in for service at the end of last month and the service rep said that the tech was annoyed that I brought it in for rattling/noises as this should be expected from a car.
vtfz83,I left the shop with the problem not fixed.
vtfz83,I placed another service appointment today and I plan to be more assertive with not leaving until the problem is fixed.
vtfz83,Has anyone else had rattling/ noises that they have asked Tesla to fix and we’re told the same thing?
vtfz83,Did you escalate it to a manager on the spot?
vtfz83,I feel like I should not have accepted that response from the rep and I should have not left until the noise/rattling was corrected.
vtfz83,Maybe you have fixed the problem yourself?
vtfz83,Let me know what you’ve done.
vtfz83,Thanks!
1bhbnf2,FSD 12.3 single pull only?
1bhbnf2,Updated to FSD 12.3 this morning.
1bhbnf2,"Somehow I can’t change the setting of autopilot activation to double pull, it’s greyed out."
1bhbnf2,I suppose this is a bug right?
18wcumo,First External Review of FSD v12X post:  #FSD beta v12.1 is finally here.
18wcumo,I received the OTA update while our family was vacationing at Universal Studios in LA.
18wcumo,I couldn't wait to get home and upgrade to FSD.
18wcumo,"The release notes for 12.1 were surprisingly simple, stating that v12 has single-stack end-to-end neural nets trained with millions of video clips for the driving controls."
18wcumo,This replaces the previous 300k lines of C++ imperative programming.
18wcumo,"Essentially, we now have to ""trust the nets""."
18wcumo,"So, how do I feel about FSD v12 after driving 500 miles?"
18wcumo,Here is a quick rundown:  Positive Surprises  The car drives more like a human.
18wcumo,My wife couldn't tell whether it was me driving the vehicle or the car itself.
18wcumo,"Highway situations:  FSD v11 (single-stack highway and locals) already handled highway driving quite well, but you could still sense the mechanistic nature of the C++ code in the control decisions."
18wcumo,FSD v12 feels so natural.
18wcumo,Here's one scenario that really surprised me: You're driving in the fast lane (left) of a two-lane highway because slower cars stay in the right lane.
18wcumo,Then a faster car approaches from behind.
18wcumo,"FSD v12 signals, safely switches to the slower lane, lets the faster car pass, then switches back into the fast lane and stays there."
18wcumo,Speed control is much smoother and appears to adjust itself smoothly with the surrounding traffic flow.
18wcumo,FSD v12 is more patient and assertive during lane-changing maneuvers.
18wcumo,"There's no more ""middle-of-the-change hesitation"" (changing mind in the middle of a lane change)."
18wcumo,"City steets driving:  One of the ""hardest"" problems that FSD v11 and earlier versions failed to solve in my nearly three years of testing FSD beta is a surprisingly simple setup – what I call ""neighborhood laneless road snaking""."
18wcumo,"It's very common in neighborhoods, where there are single-lane roads wide enough to accommodate roadside parking, or simply single lanes that gradually diverge into more lanes, or vice versa."
18wcumo,"All previous FSD versions struggled and tended to snake left and right within what the car perceived as a ""wide"" lane."
18wcumo,"Because of this single defect, I could never convince my wife to trust FSD driving."
18wcumo,"Well, that's finally gone in v12 with the end-to-end neural networks for driving controls – it simply learns how a good human driver would handle such a situation – just stays the course."
18wcumo,v12's handling of bumps is excellent!
18wcumo,"It reduces speed very smoothly to about 10 mph while going across bumps, making the ride super smooth."
18wcumo,"Areas for Improvement  STOP signs: The car really doesn't have to wait a full 5 seconds (I know it's less than that, but it definitely feels that way) at every STOP sign."
18wcumo,"Every time, I have to push the accelerator to make it go a bit faster."
18wcumo,"Even if I had the patience, I'm sure the driver behind me wouldn't – they'd be thinking, ""What the hell, you're driving a Tesla""?"
18wcumo,!
18wcumo,Perfect speed control is challenging because some speed signs are simply incorrect.
18wcumo,"You can't have a 40 MPH speed limit right in the middle of a highway, or try to accelerate to 70 MPH during a ramp onto the highway."
18wcumo,"It's definitely better in v12, but this still remains the main input I have to adjust from time to time."
18wcumo,Road conditions can sometimes be dangerous.
18wcumo,"There may be potholes, foreign objects that a good driver would constantly stay alert for and safely maneuver around with fine steering adjustments."
18wcumo,"I haven't tested FSD v12 enough in such situations, but I believe it will need continuous training to accommodate all these hazardous road situations and learn how to safely handle them."
18wcumo,"As stated by Tesla, it is now mainly trained for good weather conditions (such as in California), and still needs a lot more training in areas with heavy precipitation, including rain and snow."
18wcumo,Conclusion  FSD v12 with single-stack neural networks for driving controls is definitely the (ONLY) right path forward.
18wcumo,"In fact, I think Tesla should have taken this approach much earlier rather than wasting time and effort tuning the C++ code for driving controls, which would have made it practically impossible to realize true FSD."
18wcumo,"Now with FSD v12, I see a step change that fundamentally solves those ""hard-to-solve"" issues – just mimic humans!"
18wcumo,The rest is just more data and more training.
18wcumo,That's it!
y1ar17,2022.20.18 (10.69.2.
y1ar17,3 FSD Beta) seems notably improvedThis version just downloaded to my 2021 raven model S last night and I’ve been testing at this morning.
y1ar17,"Finally, a lot of the trouble spots by my house actually seem to be fixed!"
y1ar17,"There was a spot on Colorado Boulevard where the car would always try to get into the left lane no matter what even if a right turn was coming up, and for the first time, it didn’t do that this morning."
y1ar17,"Turns are a lot smoother and accurate, and the car doesn’t wait and pause confused as much."
y1ar17,"I made 3 trips this morning, in traffic and the car did great on all 3."
y1ar17,"After being pretty frustrated with the beta I’m cautiously optimistic today, finally."
y1ar17,Not sure how this release has been for you all.
11moao7,Dirty Tesla's FSD Beta 11.3.
11moao7,1 drive
45463l,Is Tesla's autopilot feature about to be fast-tracked for road use?
45463l,"In [a letter to google](http://recode.net/2016/02/09/federal-government-will-treat-googles-driverless-car-system-as-a-legal-driver/) yesterday, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration asserted that driverless systems are ""legally adequate"" for the road in regards to their vehicles."
45463l,"Considering the google car doesn't even have a steering wheel, I'd imagine that Tesla would elicit a similar response."
45463l,What do you think?
45463l,Is their system just as robust as Google's?
45463l,What are the considerable differences or similarities that would effect such a decision for Tesla?
7ifdjd,"Torn b/w the new Nissan Leaf and Model 3Traffic Adaptive Cruise Control and Lane Centering is no longer a luxury, it’s a must."
7ifdjd,Leaf has ProPilot.
7ifdjd,"Model 3 has Autopilot, out for several years now and evolving."
7ifdjd,"On display, ProPilot is a static dumb display and does not show the situational “live” view the way Tesla does."
7ifdjd,It’s another indicator of how much more innovative Tesla is when it comes to software.
7ifdjd,"Other EVs can also be ruled out as no-go, having no semblance of Autopilot/ProPilot."
7ifdjd,360 Birds-eye View is truly helpful.
7ifdjd,It’s very convenient if you drive and park in dense settings.
7ifdjd,Leaf and other cars have had it for years.
7ifdjd,"Once you’ve had it, it also falls into must-have territory."
7ifdjd,"Tesla is yet to come up with it, sadly."
7ifdjd,One-pedal driving is great.
7ifdjd,Option to not creep is also great.
7ifdjd,"So far, Tesla is the only one I know of that gives an option of no-creep."
7ifdjd,Other EV manufacturers create artificial creep just so a driver used to fossil car creep will not have any familiarity dissonance.
7ifdjd,Now you’re stuck trying to prevent creep from creeping when you don’t want it to.
7ifdjd,A vestige of fossil cars that’s not necessary with EVs.
7ifdjd,Leaf has no option to turn off annoying creep.
7ifdjd,Leaf costs much less and is being built for all 50 states as we speak.
7ifdjd,Model 3 low cost version not until summer 2018.
7ifdjd,Leaf has a stronger motor than previous Leaves.
7ifdjd,Leafs are no slouch tbh—plenty of torque—the perception of slow is because drivers are deliberately economizing for range.
7ifdjd,"However, they can be driven assertively without effort and leave many fossil cars behind."
7ifdjd,"Model 3 is another level more powerful, but it’s good to point out that electric motors are more assertive than combustion engines and at a base minimum you won’t be wanting with what the Leaf’s electric motor can bring."
7ifdjd,Vestigial fossil-like controls and bad software UI of the Leaf can be annoying.
7ifdjd,Why does it need a start button?
7ifdjd,The Tesla way is genius.
7ifdjd,"You’re in, it’s on."
7ifdjd,Flick the lever and you’re on the move.
7ifdjd,The 5 inch screen is useless.
7ifdjd,Navigation readability is useless with its display only a little better than Garmins from 1999.
7ifdjd,The Leaf is probably more reliable.
7ifdjd,"For the Leaf or any non-Tesla EV, finding a reliable, decent, and convenient place to charge is still a Wild West."
7ifdjd,It’s a bad experience finding an EVGo or ChargePoint that’s more often than not isn’t ready (broken or requires a call to remotely activate).
7ifdjd,Owner operators of these charging points have no incentive to repair or make convenient.
7ifdjd,Supercharger stations are Tesla’s secret that other EV manufacturers dare not mention.
7ifdjd,There is something to a system with an incentive to make it succeed.
7ifdjd,Two shared J1772 stations that don’t work in a makeshift spot at a dealer’s lot who could care less = a bad experience.
7ifdjd,Multiply across the land and it’s a bad experience multiplied.
7ifdjd,A Nissan Leaf is a car I can have less anxiety about when parking.
7ifdjd,"If you don’t want attention, it’s a subtle car without the fuss."
7ifdjd,There are humans who envy if they see you in a Tesla and their lesser natures are revealed.
7ifdjd,The Nissan Leaf is affordable for what it offers.
7ifdjd,"They both don’t have drag-free coasting, zero-regen mode which Ioniq and e-Golf have."
7ifdjd,Except those other cars don’t have decent Level 2 the way Leaf and Model 3 do.
7ifdjd,What’s a guy to do.
c4gv6b,AP1 improvements - 2019.20.2.
c4gv6b,1Hi - so received the update last night for my MS 85D and today drove 350 miles to the beach.
c4gv6b,Noticing a few tweaks that have improved AP1 a bit.
c4gv6b,"First is the when there is a truck or car next to you hugging the line and the sonar symbols got yellow, my car would move over in the lane to add some distance."
c4gv6b,First time I’ve seen it do this consistently every time.
c4gv6b,Second - lane changes with AP1 on seem to be much quicker now and more abrupt.
c4gv6b,Very nice.
1c1pmgp,How would you describe the difference between chill/average/aggressive modes in FSD v12?
1c1pmgp,Which one do you prefer to use regularly?

1bofwqi,City Streets/Highway FSD Inflection PointI’ve been putting heavy miles on v12.3+ that include a lot of city streets-to-highway-to-city streets action.
1bofwqi,"In my opinion, we’ve reached the inflection point where the city streets stack is better in most ways than the legacy highway stack."
1bofwqi,"The main areas that highlight this for me are:  **Planning** — 12.3’s lane selection, opportunism in getting into gaps in traffic, and generally not getting itself into positions where it risks missing a turn are better than the highway stack, which still doesn’t plan far enough ahead and often isn’t assertive enough to do what needs to be done in heavy traffic."
1bofwqi,"**Speed Control** — Despite the bug that makes 12.3 drive extra slow sometimes, when it works the “just flow with traffic” setting is great."
1bofwqi,Far better than the rudimentary “pick a speed limit offset and hope it’s similar to what other people are doing” thing is on the highway.
1bofwqi,"**Maneuvering** — I never thought much of it until now, but highway driving feels very robotic after feeling how 12.3 changes lanes, assertiveness, and overall driving *feel*."
1bofwqi,This has caught me off guard because I had just accepted that the reverse was always true and likely would be well into the future.
1bofwqi,Makes me wonder how long until everything is unified on the E2E NN architecture…
12bfep7,FSD 11 Highway Lane HuggingI had a 4 hour highway drive yesterday and I was really impressed with FSD 11.3.
12bfep7,5.
12bfep7,One major behavior change that I really enjoyed was the car will hug the opposite side of the lane if you are next to or passing a large vehicle or tractor trailer.
12bfep7,It also handles lanes that are lined with cones much better.
12bfep7,"Also, you can left and right click the right hand scroll wheel to adjust between chill, average, and assertive."
12bfep7,This works incredibly well.
12bfep7,Chill will stay in your lane and very rarely change lanes to pass if not required.
12bfep7,Average will take most opportunities to get in the faster lane.
12bfep7,"Finally, I’ve noticed the time between nags seems to be much longer than before."
12bfep7,This is a huge improvement on the highway over the legacy autopilot stack.
12bfep7,Great work Tesla team!
16ovyus,My thoughts on FSDFor the next month I have quite a few 3+ hour one way drives for work so I decided to do one month of the FSD subscription.
16ovyus,Today was day 1 and I used it for a total of 4 hours.
16ovyus,"Pros:  - It was nice to sit back and let the car do the work and made the drive a little less painful - I liked not having to think too much about when my exits are coming up - it was nice to be able to subscribe last night and get in the car this morning and everything was ready to go without an additional sw update needed - a little bit fun and enjoyable for the short term  Cons: - was a little scary at times not gonna lie, the auto lane change was happing more than I would have thought and any time the speed limit changed to something lower fsd slammed on the brakes even when nothing was in front of me (I guess that’s phantom braking?"
16ovyus,?
16ovyus,") - obviously is not 100% reliable, it got confused when going onto exit ramps or merging and I took over multiple times because I didn’t know what to expect  - local roads it is still very finicky on, missed my turn completely which was fine because I was testing it out but it didn’t impede on my trip  - I have the auto Lane change set to average which I didn’t expect much from but I think I should’ve kept it on chill because it was in my opinion very assertive, I can only imagine what “aggressive” mode is like but I don’t want to find out  Overall: would I spend $15k on it?"
16ovyus,Absolutely not.
16ovyus,For the multiple drives I’m taking in one month is it worth the $200?
16ovyus,Sure but I would only subscribe when I need it and if I knew there were multiple long trips or one really long trip coming up…would not pay for just one short ride.
16ovyus,Is it something that I felt 100% safe and care free in?
16ovyus,"No, you definitely need to be vigilant, but maybe it just takes getting used to."
16ovyus,"Otherwise, pleasantly surprised at how it made a 3 hour rush hour less work and brainpower"
1c4n8q6,FSD not respecting speed limits?
1c4n8q6,Recently I have had issues with FSD v12 taking forever to slow down when the speed limit decreases.
1c4n8q6,Some places this is not really an issue and probably what most human drivers would do but it becomes problematic when the limit goes from 80 km/h to 40 km/h into a school zone or on some of our highways where the speed regularly goes from 90 km/h to 50 km/h through small towns where the speed is regularly patrolled.
1c4n8q6,The car definitely knows the speed limit as it shows the correct limit on screen and FSD does not even slow down if I try to manually use the scroll wheel to slow it.
1c4n8q6,Its quite frustrating as im having to take over frequently for this.
17a6caj,11.4.
17a6caj,7.2 won't exit passing lane when stalk is manually pressed and continual occlusion warningsdrove from Houston to Daytona beach yesterday and had some new issues with new fsd release.
17a6caj,"after passing vehicles in passing lane, i manually pushed stalk to initiate lane change back to cruising lane."
17a6caj,signal would flash but M3 would not exit the passing lane in timely fashion.
17a6caj,"vehicles behind me, anxious for me to return to cruising lane so they could pass me often began cutting into cruising lane to pass me on right before my M3 would execute lane change."
17a6caj,embarrassing to sit in the lane with the signal on but not moving over and dangerous since understandably annoyed drivers behind me would often begin to make their move into the cruising lane at same time M3 eventually decided to move over.
17a6caj,this happened inconsistently but most times it exhibited this behavior.
17a6caj,"also, when driving at night, got continual warnings about fsd being degraded due to one or more side camera occluded."
17a6caj,"as there were many (many, many) recharging stops on this trip, i cleaned the cameras several times to no avail."
17a6caj,still love the car and fsd but this was new behavior for me and my 2020 M3 RWD.
zul7t9,TACC + Autosteer not slowing down for lane merges?
zul7t9,"Note: I don't have FSD, just the basic TACC + Autosteer on an early 2021 Model 3."
zul7t9,"When driving on a highway, I tend to just stay in the right lane at 65-75mph, turn on TACC + Autosteer, and mostly let the car do its thing."
zul7t9,"In a lot of highways, the right lane sometimes abruptly ends and merges into the lane to the left of it."
zul7t9,Or an entirely new set of vehicles is merging onto the highway from the right side into my lane.
zul7t9,Why can the TACC + Autosteer not detect this and slow down?
zul7t9,"90% of the time, it DOESN'T do what a human would do, which is to slow down and let the slightly faster car on your right that is clearly attempting to switch into your lane actually complete the lane change."
zul7t9,"Instead, Autosteer stubbornly maintains its speed and it has caused some near-misses for me where the merge lane on my right was ending and the driver just barely switched into my lane before it ended."
zul7t9,I always end up needing to take control and avoid a potential collision by either slowing down rapidly or speeding up really fast.
zul7t9,"I know the full FSD has drive settings for assertiveness, does that fix this?"
zul7t9,Or is this only a problem in the TACC + Autosteer combo?
zul7t9,I'm just surprised that it can't handle this scenario while working almost flawlessly otherwise.
hcybcs,"The Oatmeal • Magical Space Car Revisited(I posted this earlier on TMC forum, then thought y’all might like to see it too."
hcybcs,)  I’ve had my Model S Long Range Plus for a couple of months now.
hcybcs,"I was just taking another look at this old cartoon → [https://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla\_model\_s](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla_model_s)      I’m not sure if that was first published in 2012 or 2013, but it must  have been thereabouts."
hcybcs,"In 2020 is the Model S still a Magical Space Car,  an Intergalactic SpaceBoat of Light and Wonder, an Electric  CruiseBeast?"
hcybcs,"Or is it, as CNET Roadshow asserted, in dire need of a  refresh?"
hcybcs,Mine is different in a number of notable ways from the car that The Oatmeal gushed over.
hcybcs,RANGE.
hcybcs,"He wrote: “After seven months and 4,000+ miles of owning a Model  S, any ‘range anxiety’ I used to have has been completely quelled”."
hcybcs,"Also, “I have the 85 KWh battery, which can go up to 260 miles on a  single charge”."
hcybcs,"When I placed my order for a S Long Range, it was advertised as having  373 miles range."
hcybcs,"Before my car was built, Tesla switched production to  the Long Range Plus version, and a few days ago I got my firmware update  to the new official 402 miles EPA rating."
hcybcs,"After having the car for a  couple of months I am beginning to understand, in practical terms, just  how much overkill that is."
hcybcs,"Also, when it comes to charging stations…  Man, the Supercharger network today is a world beyond the fledgling  network that The Oatmeal barely mentioned in passing."
hcybcs,The whole USA is  valid for road trips now.
hcybcs,It’s almost too easy.
hcybcs,"If anything, I might  sort of miss the pioneering spirit that driving cross-country in an EV  required only a few years ago."
hcybcs,Where’s the challenge now?
hcybcs,CAMPING.
hcybcs,"On the subject of driving cross-country… When The Oatmeal  published his story, camping in Teslas hadn’t even really been  discovered yet."
hcybcs,"One lady here in town peeked in the back of my car and  gasped, “It has more space than my Ford Explorer!"
hcybcs,"” Yes, there is plenty  of room to stretch out."
hcybcs,It could charge from an RV hookup while I sleep  in the back.
hcybcs,"That reminds me, I need to put in my order for a Dreamcase."
hcybcs,THE ACCELERATION.
hcybcs,"Quote, “My Model S can go from 0-60 in five seconds,  and because it’s completely noiseless, accelerating feels like being  fired out of a gun with a silencer on”."
hcybcs,I’ve sometimes wondered if I should have splashed out the extra cash  (lots of it!
hcybcs,) for a Performance model.
hcybcs,Then I notice that my LR+ can do  0-60 in 3.7 seconds.
hcybcs,That is not a slow car by any means.
hcybcs,My old Lotus  Esprit V8 couldn’t match that.
hcybcs,"(I think the Lotus might have an  advantage in overtaking at highway speed, but not by very much."
hcybcs,") By the  way, I do notice torque steer when I floor the S. It’s not ideal, but I  can live with that."
hcybcs,"It adds a bit of extra drama to launches, as the  wheel jerks in my hands and I hang on for dear life."
hcybcs,OLD AND BUSTED.
hcybcs,"According to CNET Roadshow, “One area where the Model S  is clearly lagging behind is design”."
hcybcs,"Also, “Things are beginning to  look awfully plain”."
hcybcs,"Also, “In a segment that prioritizes freshness,  visually, the Model S is anything but”."
hcybcs,I laughed and laughed at this.
hcybcs,"Well, I guess it must depend on where you  live."
hcybcs,"If you are in California and there have been Model Ses swarming  around you on the highways for years, then maybe it looks plain to you."
hcybcs,I  live in Texas.
hcybcs,"Rural, small-town Texas."
hcybcs,"My car is still a novelty here,  drawing plenty of both questions and compliments."
hcybcs,"And I think it still  looks great, especially in a world that is being gradually taken over by  chunky, homely, generic SUVs and crossovers."
hcybcs,My main gripe about the Model S’s appearance is one that could apply to  all Teslas now.
hcybcs,The selection of factory colors is very limited.
hcybcs,"I  happen to like bright, vivid colors, and you can get any bright color  you want as long as it’s red."
hcybcs,"I admit the red does look good, but still…  We need more color on our highways, and I’ve been feeling a little envy  towards all those Jeep Wranglers around town that look like they  escaped from a bag of Skittles."
hcybcs,That’s why I bought a white Model S and  am getting it wrapped in “Atomic Teal” vinyl.
hcybcs,THE CLASSIC.
hcybcs,"The Oatmeal observed, “Being fully electric, the Model S is  completely noiseless, which was jarring at first because every time I  came to a stop I thought that the motor had stalled."
hcybcs,It also makes  parking lots rather interesting because pedestrians can’t hear my Ultra  Stealth NinjaCar as it approaches”.
hcybcs,Regulations have been on the books for a few years now requiring  electric cars to have pedestrian warning systems (noise makers)  operating at low speeds.
hcybcs,"However, actually pinning down the details of  those regs and getting them into effect has been delayed and delayed."
hcybcs,"The Model 3 now comes with a noise maker, but my Model S LR+ doesn’t  have one."
hcybcs,Maybe I got one of the last cars to be free from that nuisance  feature of dubious worth.
hcybcs,"Likewise, there have been persistent rumors of the Model S and X getting  a single landscape-oriented screen like the 3 and Y, but mine still has  both the dash display and the large, portrait-oriented screen."
hcybcs,"Personally, I like it that way."
hcybcs,"More screen is more better, and I find  the portrait screen divides up nicely into map, camera and music  windows."
hcybcs,"Oh, and then there’s the Unlimited Free Supercharging."
hcybcs,"It may be  somewhat wasted on me, as I don’t expect to use it heavily, but hey…  That’s still pretty sweet to have."
hcybcs,"To all those guys who are still waiting because they think there’s a  refresh right around the corner… Enjoy your pedestrian noisemakers,  piddling little landscape screen and paying for Supercharging."
hcybcs,I will be  happy with my “classic” Model S.      CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.
hcybcs,"Shortly after getting my car, I took it out for a  spin on one damp morning after some spring showers, and I went around  the county’s dirt roads."
hcybcs,The sure-footedness of this heavy car as it  splashed through puddles and around muddy corners was amazing.
hcybcs,"I felt  perfect control, never a hint of slippage."
hcybcs,"Dual-motor all-wheel-drive,  with precise, electronic modulation of power front-and-rear, is a  wonderful thing."
hcybcs,Washing all that mud off afterwards was less wonderful.
hcybcs,Car needs a non-stick coating.
hcybcs,"Are you working on that, Elon?"
hcybcs,"Next I went down to “The Farm” which is notorious for its neglected,  rocky, washed-out road."
hcybcs,"I dialed the suspension up to maximum height and  slowly, carefully eased the car down the road and over the rocks — with  it beeping and flashing warnings at me the entire way, but it never did  actually scrape bottom."
hcybcs,So… Why do I need a SUV again?
1bz1idl,FSD drives below the speed limit?
1bz1idl,"I am not sure how common this is, I asked Tesla employees about this and they said they do not have this issue."
1bz1idl,"I have my car in assertive, I also have the speed limit offset to be 5mph faster than the speed limit."
1bz1idl,"When I had the regular autopilot, it worked great and would go the speed I set it to, but with FSD it drives so slow."
1bz1idl,"Keep in mind I am talking about when no cars are around, and when they are around, it does not matter the condition it will always drive below the speed limit for me."
1bz1idl,Do you have this issue too?
1bz1idl,I have a 2023 M3P
1ce0v6t,What do I do?
1ce0v6t,What happened?
117rji1,"FSD unusable but easy for Tesla to fixWith FSD active, no matter what profile you set - chill, average, assertive - the car will often change into the left lane when the travel speed is less than the set speed."
117rji1,"Many people set a delta speed target so that they are not impeding traffic flow, but they certainly don't want the car to constantly change lanes and annoy everyone."
117rji1,It even does this when you have an upcoming right turn in 500ft.
117rji1,Ridiculous.
117rji1,There's no reason to have chill/average/assertive control follow distance either - there's an easy scroll wheel follow distance setting.
117rji1,They need a separate setting to control speed-based lane changes.
117rji1,And have a lane change - 'only for exits' option that never does speed related lane changes.
117rji1,The user can then flip the turn signal to get FSD to make a lane change when this option is active.
117rji1,"As is, this is completely unusable."
117rji1,I'm effectively unable to use AutoSteer with an FSD user settings profile.
19en9h1,"FSD beta QuestionAll right, quick dumb question."

1btkqq5,"FSD Trial Day 1 LearningsDrove 400 miles today for work with the vast majority being on FSD today, my first day of the trial (2022 MYP)."
1btkqq5,"Mix of interstate, backroads, and city driving."
1btkqq5,Never had/used FSD before so what an opportune day to start my trial.
1btkqq5,I tried Chill and Average.
1btkqq5,Did not try Assertive mode.
1btkqq5,"Here are some things I noticed:  —As someone else mentioned, FSD brakes way too late and way too hard for my liking at times."
1btkqq5,Definitely created some uncomfortable stops.
1btkqq5,"—I drive like a grandma so the hard acceleration from every stop when no other vehicles were in front not only annoyed me, but made me think people who use FSD heavily must go thru tires much more quickly."
1btkqq5,"—FSD really struggled to capture new speed limits and change speeds, especially at 65mph limit; Happened probably 10x where it would still show 55mph."
1btkqq5,"—I do not like constantly being in the middle lane on 3-lane highway, usually I use the slow lane."
1btkqq5,FSD definitely prefers middle lane.
1btkqq5,"—Furthermore, on 2-lane roads, it kept putting me in the fast lane despite me sticking to the speed limit."
1btkqq5,Big pet peeve when not actively passing.
1btkqq5,—FSD struggled to accelerate from lights when trucks/slow vehicles were in front of me.
1btkqq5,It kept leaping forward only to have to slow right back down.
1btkqq5,"—Lastly, FSD adjustment to new speed limits was lethargic and erratic at best."
1btkqq5,I feel like Autopilot handles this better.
1btkqq5,"Haven’t tried AutoPark or Summon yet, but neither have much appeal to me."
1btkqq5,"I know it’s only the first day, but this definitely is not worth the money to me over basic AP."
1biwsig,Super excited!
1biwsig,Getting FSD 12.3 now!

v382sk,"My robotaxi driver (FSD) is rated as a poor driver (53%) by the State Farm AppWith all the talk about safety scores, I think it’s always important to continue to rate the source."
v382sk,"If robotaxis are to become a thing, and they will all have the same driver, that driver needs to be a good driver."
v382sk,I don’t know the best app to use but State Farm has one that appears to be good and free so I tried using that to rate FSD as a driver.
v382sk,I ran the first one this morning which was a 2 mile commute from home to my office.
v382sk,10.12.2.
v382sk,"The 2 mile commute has two left turns, one at a stop sign, one at a light, and two right turns, one at a stop sign and one at a light."
v382sk,"7:30 am, moderate traffic."
v382sk,In that short trip I got 9 alerts.

v382sk,I looked this up before posting and see only posts on Tesla’s Safe Driving Score.
v382sk,Does anyone else use a strategy/app to rate FSD as a driver?

eoxry7,Autopilot veered off on uneven surface on a freeway.
eoxry7,That was unexpected.
eoxry7,I have done over 15.000 miles on autopilot and I'm very happy with it.
eoxry7,I have driven over this little dent in the freeway hundreds of times without any issues until yesterday.
eoxry7,The car veered off without any warning.
eoxry7,"No blinker, no chimes, no flashing warnings on the console."
eoxry7,I could feel that the autopilot was turning the steering wheel left.
eoxry7,"Luckily, I was paying attention and I took over in the nick of time."
eoxry7,"There was a car in the lane on the left and I'm sure he wasn't pleased with that maneuver, either."
eoxry7,It goes to show that one really should keep a hand on the steering wheel when driving on autopilot.

62zis4,We're getting slammed
icpntl,"As someone who does not send their food back when the order is wrong because shy, how do I properly refuse the car during delivery day?"
icpntl,TLDR at the bottom.
icpntl,I am expecting delivery of the Y soon and I have a list of things I can inspect in/on the car to see if it should be sent back/should I refuse delivery.
icpntl,I am nervous because of all the negative reviews people have been posting on this sub.
icpntl,I want some help on what should I do if and when I find something wrong with the car.
icpntl,"For someone who is very shy, I never send back food, or complain that my friend didn't pay me back enough money that they borrowed, or return a shirt I bought from amazon because it was the wrong size."
icpntl,"The first and only car that I actually bought, I ended up paying $3k more because I didn't know how to negotiate/haggle."
icpntl,"Much of this is because I am introverted, anxious, and just feel like I am being rude."
icpntl,"A little bit of it is because I am also lazy, I don't want to get through all the trouble just to get something small fixed to what I want."
icpntl,When I was young it was my mother who would take care of things.
icpntl,Now I just have me.
icpntl,"However, you guys all know, this thing isn't just a $20 shirt or a $12 food."
icpntl,I will be sinking $60k into this car so I actually want what I ordered.
icpntl,"I have always wanted a tesla and now that it is in within my reach, I am getting more nervous every day when I see a bad review."
icpntl,I was wondering if you guys have any advice on what I should say/do should I refuse delivery of my car.
icpntl,I want to be assertive but not sound like an entitled a\*\*hole.
icpntl,"Everyone keeps saying ""refuse at delivery"" but I actually don't understand how that works."
icpntl,Should I just literally turn around and walk away?
icpntl,Should I say a few things?
icpntl,Tell em a piece of my mind?
icpntl,Should I call my mom to do it for me?
icpntl,"But in all seriousness, I would like some help on what I should do at the door."
icpntl,I am hoping and praying I don't need to do this but at the very least I want to be prepared.
icpntl,I haven't seen it posted here so I thought I should give it a shot.
icpntl,"If we get enough replies, people can also use this thread if they are someone like me."
icpntl,&#x200B;  **TLDR:** I am a shy person and I was wondering if you have tips on how to refuse my car on delivery.
eoso3q,I bought a used Tesla Model S four months agoand I still haven't gotten app access!
eoso3q,It's killing me!
eoso3q,I live in Canada and its super cold and I really want to use the app to remotely turn on the heat in my car.
eoso3q,I've emailed customer service and called them and they told me to send my info to changeofownershipna@tesla.com and I sent them an email a couple weeks ago and sent it again last week; still nothing.
eoso3q,Anyone have any advice for me?
eoso3q,"I also tweeted Elon, just in case it might work."
eoso3q,"Edit: apparently all this brouhaha on reddit lit a fire under someone's ass, cause i just got an email saying my Tesla got added to my account!"

pmegw8,Model 3 - Beta FSD 10 - Test Loop 1 - 2021.24.15 - 11 Sept 2021
4ewa59,Tesla opened up their patents in June 2014.
4ewa59,Are there any car manufacturers that are applying this technology into their cars?
4ewa59,"If not, why?"
96qvta,"First 10 months of owning a Tesla Model X in SoCal, by the numbersMy ""year 1"" analysis won't happen until October, when I'll have 1 year of solid data from TeslaFi.com to analyze."
96qvta,"However, this is 10 months of ownership, and before my annual job/gig starts where I'll be driving 300mi/week commuting to work."
96qvta,"I'm curious how even more driving will change this data, if at all."
96qvta,"For the record, I purchased and received my Tesla Model X 75D as new inventory vehicle from Maryland, received the vehicle on June 30, 2017."
96qvta,"I used a friend's referral code, so I received a discount and free unlimited supercharging for life of vehicle."
96qvta,Service center repair/visits include:  1.
96qvta,"Body shop/repair for passenger side FWD realignment, repaired in 3 days while I was out of town."
96qvta,2.
96qvta,"Passenger side FWD proximity sensor came loose, door frequently thought an obstruction was near the door, preventing it from opening without override."
96qvta,<1 day repair.
96qvta,3.
96qvta,"Uncorking, <1 day repair."
96qvta,4.
96qvta,"Annual service (12 month), I had damaged the passenger rear fender flair, Service Center in Burbank had the part in stock."
96qvta,"Cost was $55, installation was free (took less than 15 minutes to remove old and install new)."
96qvta,"<1 day repair, but I needed to travel for work, so I took a Model S 100D loaner."
96qvta,"Some data:   I'm on SoCal Edison Time of Use ""B"" plan, so summer months (June - Sept), overnight charging costs $0.12/kWh."
96qvta,"Rest of the year, overnight is $0.13/kWh."
96qvta,I didn't pull all the data or try to dive into costs of charging during summer vs charging rest of the year.
96qvta,"Since the bulk of my data is October 2017 through August 2018, I'll price it closer to the non-summer pricing, $0.13/kWh."
96qvta,"3 of 10 months at $0.12/kWh, so let's say $0.127/kWh on my data."
96qvta,"My use of the unlimited free supercharging since October 2017: 1394.36kWh, or $177.08 not charging at home."
96qvta,"My charging at home: 5055.8kWh, or roughly $642.09, from October 2017 to August 2018."
96qvta,"Since I bought my car, I've driven 18,286.17 miles in 13.5 months."
96qvta,"I only have data from October 20, 2017, where my earliest Odometer reading was 13,471.88 miles."
96qvta,That brings the cost per mile of operation (not counting cost to own) down to $0.0477 per mile.
96qvta,"No way to count how many miles using EAP, but it has made longer road trips much more enjoyable and easier."
96qvta,"Total maintenance cost so far was $650 for the first ""annual"" 12 month service."
96qvta,"Also, had to buy a rear wheel flair for $55, installation was gratis."
96qvta,Repair/maintenance costs in 10 months: $705.
96qvta,"BMW X6 M is another 6000 GVWR vehicle, gas tank is 22.4 gallons, and gas economy is 14/19."
96qvta,So is the X5.
96qvta,"2019 Buick Enclave also, gas tank is 22 gallons, and gas economy is 17/25."
96qvta,"Assuming a gas price of $3.10 (which is actually less than real world prices in LA), every fill up is $68.20."
96qvta,"If doing all freeway driving in any of those 3 vehicles (a large assumption, keep it in mind when considering costs; driving these cars in traditional SoCal traffic, geography, and weather, will result in lower mileage), you're looking at 418 miles to 550 miles per tank."
96qvta,"13,471.88 miles would require 24.5 to 32.2 fill ups, costing anywhere between $1,670.9 and $2,196.04."
96qvta,"On the cheaper end, Ford Explorer is listed as a 6000 GVWR vehicle, has an 18.6 gallon tank, costs $57.66 to fill up, claims 19/27 gas economy, alleges 502.2 miles per tank, 26.8 fill ups to cover 13,471.88 miles, costing $1,545.288, $154.53 per month, and would have cost $903.20 more than charging at home."
96qvta,"For driving, this is between $0.1147 and $0.163 per mile."
96qvta,"I did my best to create lowball assumptions so these assumptions and ""conclusions"" don't seem to intentionally beat up ICE vehicles."
96qvta,"Spending $642.09 on charging, which yields a net savings of $1,028.81 to $1,553.95 compared to those vehicles."
96qvta,"Over 10 months, that's $102.88 to $155.40 per month not spent on gas."
96qvta,"Also, not driving one of those vehicles, that's 2 oil changes that weren't necessary during 10 months of operation (assuming 7,500 miles between oil changes)."
96qvta,"Driving a Tesla Model X or S with unlimited supercharging, for me, was 2.6 to 3.4 times cheaper (per mile) to drive."
96qvta,"Brake pad degeneration is minimal, tires will probably require replacement at 40,000 miles (as per usual, but might be sooner, EV's do wear down tire tread faster)."
96qvta,"Vehicle registration was definitely more costly, I renewed the registration when I was still living in Los Angeles county, I think my registration fee for 2018 was just under $900."
96qvta,"Obviously, a cheaper vehicle would have cost less for registration."
96qvta,"Battery degeneration: using TeslaFi.com to track my battery data, my ""Battery Report"" shows my high range of 238.11 and low range of 231.51."
96qvta,"Looking at Staring range, I was at 235.88 and now at 231.51."
96qvta,My battery loss in the first year is 4.37 miles or 1.89%.
96qvta,The battery warranty is unlimited miles (literally infinite) and 8 years.
96qvta,"Note: when I start my new job/gig in September, I am hoping the Fontana Supercharger will be open."
96qvta,"Once open, that should save me significant charging costs, considering my lengthy daily commute."
96qvta,"I'm expecting that to have a hell of an impact on my driving per mile cost, since my driving will go to 300 miles per week, and the bulk of my charging to cover that will be at a Supercharger (free)."
96qvta,"I will keep reviewing this data to make sure I'm not too horribly mistaken in my assertions and numbers (I already had to correct the mileage difference for 10 months), I apologize in advance for any oversights."
96qvta,"If anyone has other ideas for what data to measure and compare (that might be available in TeslaFi.com as well), I'm happy to give it a look."
xj6mos,Which one?
xj6mos,Just got FSD!
1cwdb5r,Why is single or double pull greyed out on the screenIn auto pilot activation I can’t select single or double pull.
1cwdb5r,Is it possible to make a single pull regular auto pilot and a double pull fsd?
14mf3yv,Do I have FSD betaThe reason I ask is I literally subscribed and then an hour later went to my car to see how to request it.
14mf3yv,And the car had a message on the screen saying would you like to try FSD beta which I responded yes.
14mf3yv,Every post I searched said you typically have to wait a while to get beta so I'm confused.
14mf3yv,And I don't know what screen to request it from if I don't actually have it now.
14mf3yv,Would love to see a screenshot of what it's supposed to look like if I don't have it.
s9j7bt,FSD Beta Weird Lane ChangesI’ve had FSD Beta since v10.3.
s9j7bt,1 and I’ve noticed especially since 10.5 an increasing number of weird or unnecessary lane changes.
s9j7bt,None of the subsequent updates have seemed to improve this issue and in some cases it is getting worse.
s9j7bt,Here’s some common examples of what I’m experiencing:  1.
s9j7bt,"FSD makes a left turn at a light, into the left lane of a street with two lanes in each direction."
s9j7bt,"It continues driving down the road in the left lane, with little to no other traffic on the road."
s9j7bt,"Once we’re about 2 miles away from the next left turn, it will randomly get into the right lane and stays there for about half a mile or so before moving back to the left lane in order to make the upcoming left turn."
s9j7bt,"It will also do the opposite where we’re in the right lane with an upcoming right turn, and it will randomly get into the left lane for half a mile or so before moving back into the right lane to make the turn."
s9j7bt,This happens randomly and not in a specific spot each time.
s9j7bt,It also doesn’t seem to be a speed based lane change as this has happened plenty of times when there are no other cars around me.
s9j7bt,FAD does this in both Chill and Average modes - I haven’t experimented with Assertive yet.
s9j7bt,"In all of the cases I’ve experienced, the navigation on the screen appears correct and does not indicate the need for a lane change."
s9j7bt,2.
s9j7bt,This example is specific to one intersection.
s9j7bt,There’s an intersection where you’re supposed to go through the traffic light and make a left on the 3rd neighborhood street after the light.
s9j7bt,This road is one lane in each direction with a temporary left turn lane for each of the available turns into the neighborhood.
s9j7bt,"The navigation displays correctly and says to stay in the main lane, go through the light and make the 3rd left."
s9j7bt,FSD 10.3.
s9j7bt,1 executed this perfectly but beginning with 10.5 the car can’t figure it out.
s9j7bt,"It will proceed through the traffic light, immediately swerve into the 1st left turn lane, then serve back to the main lane and continue to the correct 3rd left turn."
s9j7bt,I don’t know why it has started this weird swerving maneuver where it tries to make the 1st left turn before swerving back to correct itself.
s9j7bt,Map data doesn’t appear to have changed and the navigation still gives the correct guidance.
s9j7bt,I report it each time it does it but still hasn’t been fixed.
s9j7bt,"That’s just two examples but I seem to get a fair amount of random, nonsensical lane changes and it seems to be getting more frequent with newer versions."
s9j7bt,Has anyone else experienced this or something similar?

e1jpg2,"Tesla Cybertruck Could Sabatoge Google, GM LIDAR Sensorstl;dr The new Cybertruck might set back Tesla's competitors on autonomous driving by confounding LIDAR sensors."
e1jpg2,There are two types of sensors used in the automotive industry today: passive and active.
e1jpg2,"Passive sensors, such as cameras, detect reflected ambient light."
e1jpg2,"Active sensors, like LIDAR, emit a beam of energy and detect when that same energy beam has been reflected back."
e1jpg2,"By measuring the time between emission and detection of the active sensor's energy beam, high-quality depth estimates can be ascertained from active sensing but not passive."
e1jpg2,Tesla's autonomous driving sensing strategy is unique among automakers.
e1jpg2,"While industry leaders such as Google's Waymo and GM's Cruise invest heavily in LIDAR-based vision systems for their vehicles, Elon Musk's Tesla has pursued a camera-only approach."
e1jpg2,Musk and Tesla AI Director Andrej Karpathy have repeatedly asserted that LIDAR is a 'crutch' for full autonomy and that 'anyone relying on LIDAR is doomed'.
e1jpg2,Virtually every other automaker continues to invest in LIDAR as a critical safety feature of their autonomous vehicles.
e1jpg2,Cue the new Tesla Cybertruck.
e1jpg2,"Going against conventional automotive design wisdom, this vehicle features a brutalist metal exterior with sharp edges and flat, angular surfaces."
e1jpg2,"It is not difficult to see that the Cybertruck's design, or similar designs it might inspire, could shape up to be a nightmare for LIDAR engineers."
e1jpg2,"LIDAR, being an active sensor, relies on an emitted beam being reflected back in order to detect an object."
e1jpg2,"Reflective, flat surfaces, viewed at an angle, are among the most difficult for LIDAR to detect because they bounce the emitted light in the **wrong direction**."
e1jpg2,The beam never returns to the sensor and objects go undetected.
e1jpg2,The extent of this effect remains to be seen.
e1jpg2,"If the Cybertruck's exterior is sufficiently diffusive, it could very well shape up to be a perfectly decent LIDAR target."
e1jpg2,"But if Tesla sees its competitors succeeding with LIDAR sensors, watch out for more unusual designs with reflective exteriors and sharp edges."
e1jpg2,They might just be enough to undermine Waymo's LIDAR advantage.

xwdrza,"At this point in time, I can safely (apparently) say that I am pretty adjusted to how the vehicle works."
xwdrza,Here are my impressions over the same topics I covered from a month ago.
xwdrza,"**Build Quality**  This is definitely a pretty widespread (and rightfully so) opinion at this point, though I am sure some Tesla fanboy will try to bury me with all sorts of reports and what not trying to prove it is FUD."
xwdrza,"From my own personal experience however, the build quality of my Model 3 can be best described as subpar starting from the materials all the way to the overall build."
xwdrza,Here are some of the problems I have noticed.
xwdrza,My biggest annoyance is with internal cabin noise.
xwdrza,It is LOUD inside my Model 3 (coming from a 2014 Lexus ES350).
xwdrza,"Whether it be tire / road noise, wind noise, or rattling (completely non-existent in my previous Lexus), the M3 has been by far and away the loudest car I have ever driven and louder than most cars I have ridden in."
xwdrza,"Maybe my buddy’s MS was just built better, but I don’t recall it being anywhere as loud as my M3 is."
xwdrza,"If I go over 20 mph, I start hearing road noise."
xwdrza,"If I go over 40 mph, I start hearing wind noise."
xwdrza,"If I go over 50 mph, I start hearing small rattling noises here and there."
xwdrza,"These should not be issues in a $30K priced car, much less one sold for just under $50K."
xwdrza,"Cherry on top, when I took it to the SC within a week (well within 100 miles), I was told that this was a “characteristic of the frameless design” and that Tesla would not be attempting to “fix” it for me."
xwdrza,"First off, that sounds real sketch to me."
xwdrza,I have been in cars that had frameless designs and not a single one have had those issues.
xwdrza,"Two, if your design introduces that much cabin noise, WHY would you proceed with said design?"
xwdrza,!
xwdrza,"They ended the experience by sending me home, saying to schedule another appointment if it gets worse."
xwdrza,Next would be the seats.
xwdrza,"While the material soft and have a nice feel when it’s not super hot, the non-porous material and lack of ventilated seats really make for a miserable experience in TX."
xwdrza,"My Lexus has cooled seats, why doesn’t my M3 which was more expensive by the tune of almost $10K?"
xwdrza,"Going back to the vegan leather material, I don’t care how much they make it feel like leather or how environmentally friendly it might be, non-porous (while easier to clean) is not breathable and that sucks when it’s really hot or you sat in the chair long enough to build up a lot of heat."
xwdrza,There is a reason why people prefer fabric or real leather over vegan and it’s because both have the ability to sustain you through heat much more comfortably.
xwdrza,I ended up ordering some Katzkin leather seats with their ventilated cooling on the driver side and will be getting all of that installed tomorrow.
xwdrza,"Going back to Tesla, leather seats really should have been a purchasable upgrade (similarly to their premium audio setup) for the consumers who actually want it."
xwdrza,"Paint quality, at least for my chosen blue color, is pretty thin and not evenly applied."
xwdrza,This includes both the actual paint and the clear coat applied over it.
xwdrza,"I imagine this is why a lot of people get PPF, because the paint (on the M3 at least) does get easily dinged up."
xwdrza,"I myself haven’t installed PPF yet as I didn’t consider a $2K cosmetic expense worthwhile for a $50K car, but I have since reconsidered my options given how easy it is to get swirls, chips, and fine scratches on this M3 compared to my Lexus."
xwdrza,"Now, whether that would be for full body or just the front or even just the front bumper, I am still on the fence regarding that decision."
xwdrza,**Driving Interface**  My biggest issue is the lack of even the most simplest of instrument gauge outside of the center touchscreen.
xwdrza,"While I got used to it, I still ended up purchasing recently the “Hansshow Hidden HUD” (not actually a HUD) for my steering wheel dash."
xwdrza,There is simply zero good reason of why some sort of basic dash display wasn’t included behind the steering other than to cut costs.
xwdrza,"No, I do not accept the argument that not having a basic instrument gauge behind the steering wheel is safe as it keeps your eyes on the road."
xwdrza,Something as basic as knowing how fast you are going at all times is a basic part of safe driving and the idea that glancing down and right at the center touchscreen is somehow safer than a slightly downward glance through the steering wheel gap is somehow safer is total bunk to me.
xwdrza,"Offloading most features and controls to a central touchscreen IS the future, but getting rid of all gauges from the steering wheel dash is NOT the answer."
xwdrza,"There is a reason why the MX and MS both have a steering dash display and no, it’s not because they use a yoke."
xwdrza,"**Air Conditioning**  I didn’t put this under build quality, because this is by design to cool the batters as I understand it."
xwdrza,"Regardless, the AC unit when on auto feels incredibly week compared to every other car I have driven or ridden in."
xwdrza,"I have it set to 70 on auto, which for every other car I have driven means pretty dang cold."
xwdrza,70 on my M3 feels about 77.
xwdrza,This has resulted in me running the AC much colder than I normally would have.
xwdrza,"This may be a feature, but I really dislike it as a Texan."
xwdrza,**Regenerative Braking and One Pedal Driving**  I will readily admit that I really disliked this feature in certain driving situations.
xwdrza,"Having gotten used to it finally, I can now say that I really like the feature."
xwdrza,"It allows me to not have to think about switching to the brake pedal most of the time, which is always a good thing."
xwdrza,"As far as saving battery or brake pads, I have no real opinions on this yet as I charge every day at work so power is a non-issue and the car is too new for the brake pad aspect to be validated yet."
xwdrza,"While it definitely makes sense, at the same time the M3 is a hefty car for its size so it remains to be seen on how much longer my brake pads actually last in comparison."
xwdrza,"**Overall Thoughts**  In my previous impressions post, I ended it by saying that the Tesla is less a luxury car and more a piece of smart tech."
xwdrza,"A month later, I continue to stand by that assertion."
xwdrza,"From a “car” perspective, there are some design quality and decisions that I feel none of us (consumers) should be willing to accept / tolerate and consequently allow Tesla to get away with."
xwdrza,Some (a lot) of you might disagree with that and that’s fine.
xwdrza,"Going beyond that, would I buy another Tesla?"
xwdrza,"If it’s right now, absolutely."
xwdrza,There is not a single car in the same price range that is more fun to drive on your every day roads.
xwdrza,"Among the EVs, Tesla is still far ahead of the curve in terms of hardware, software, and charging network that another EV is not really a serious consideration."
xwdrza,5-10 years from now when I am thinking about a new car though?
xwdrza,That’s hard to say as even the 2023-24 EVs (like the Hyundai IONIQ 6 for example) look very nice and charging stations should be much more populous by then.
xwdrza,"Tesla has the luxury of being really the only serious option right now, which allows them to get away from a lot of their quality and feature removal shenanigans currently, but down the line when there are other serious alternatives, I can easily seeing things coming back and biting Tesla if they don’t make some serious improvements."
xwdrza,"Oh yeah, not having to pay for gas feels good!"
1c9l591,The FSD has come a long wayI subscribed to FSD for my 21 MY the day it went down to $99.
1c9l591,I’m very impressed with how far FSD has come since the last time I tried it (last year on a loaner while my car was at the shop).
1c9l591,Keep in mind that I live in one of the “relatively” easier city streets in the country (Phoenix).
1c9l591,"So, that may helped in how much better it has gotten."
1c9l591,But there were very specific spots FSD used to freak out at that it’s handling like a champ now.
1c9l591,"Out of the drives I’ve done, the only time I’ve interfered is when it’s not being as fast or assertive as I’d like it to be so I push the pedals to help it out."
1c9l591,"This doesn’t happen often, but when it does, it’s pretty irritating because it drives like a Student Driver."

7w64ms,"[Discussion] Let's talk about ""bad faith"" for a minute..."
7w64ms,"My apologies in advance for the wall of text, but there's something we need to discuss."
7w64ms,"A recurring theme on this sub, prompted by bad news from Tesla (particularly schedule delays), is that Tesla has engaged in ""bad faith""."
7w64ms,"Sometimes, this assertion looks like an accusation: ""Model 3 delayed?"
7w64ms,But I gave them $1000!
7w64ms,Tesla is going to get sued for its bad faith!
7w64ms,"I HAVE RIGHTS, DAMMIT!"
7w64ms,!
7w64ms,"""!"
7w64ms,"As a Model 3 reservation holder (in person, 3/31), I totally understand the exquisite torture of this wait."
7w64ms,"But, as an attorney in the U.S., slinging claims of ""bad faith"" rubs me the wrong way."
7w64ms,"I've litigated consumer fraud cases and claims of ""bad faith"" negotiations or ""bad faith"" behavior, and I don't think it's fair to claim that Tesla has engaged in deceptive practices."
7w64ms,Let me explain why...
7w64ms,"Legal dictionaries define ""bad faith"" as: *intentional dishonest act by not fulfilling legal or contractual obligations, misleading another, entering into an agreement without the intention or means to fulfill it, or violating basic standards of honesty in dealing with others."
7w64ms,"*  (States typically recognize claims for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, but I'm not going to do a survey of state legislation or common law."
7w64ms,)  The basic definition is enough for our purposes.
7w64ms,Let's break down its elements:    1.
7w64ms,"""intentional dishonest act""   If there is any evidence that Tesla believed at the time the estimates were made that they could not be fulfilled, I haven't seen it."
7w64ms,Were they optimistic?
7w64ms,Probably.
7w64ms,Did they fall far short of the planned ramp?
7w64ms,Of course!
7w64ms,"But there is no evidence that Elon sat down with Voldemort, Moff Tarkin, and Lex Luthor and said ""boys, we're going to promise delivery in January, even though we can NEVER do it, because we want that sweet, sweet kilobuck from u/_rdaneel_."
7w64ms,"Now, hold my ambien-spiked syrah while I go do some dishonest shit""."
7w64ms,1.
7w64ms,"""by not fulfilling legal or contractual obligations""   Critically, your $1000 reservation fee - per the agreement with Tesla *that you accepted* - is not a ""deposit""."
7w64ms,It bears no interest and does not entitle you to anything at any time.
7w64ms,"You're holding a place in line, and can back out at any time without penalty."
7w64ms,The fine print (lawyers love fine print!
7w64ms,") says that Tesla has **not promised to sell you a car, ever."
7w64ms,** 1.
7w64ms,"""misleading another, entering into an agreement without the intention or means to fulfill it, or violating basic standards of honesty in dealing with others""   As described above, there is no evidence that Tesla ever intended to NOT sell you a Model 3."
7w64ms,"In fact, the several thousand Model 3s on the road suggest that Tesla does, indeed, want to trade your cheddar for their car."
7w64ms,"As for the ""basic standards of honesty,"" I repeat that missing a goal, even an optimistic one, is not dishonest (at least legally speaking)."
7w64ms,No state attorney general is going to pursue Tesla over this claim.
7w64ms,"""BUT, BUT, BUT TEH TAX CREDITZ""!"
7w64ms,Note that Tesla never promised that you would be entitled to a federal tax credit.
7w64ms,"Indeed, the $35,000 base price is ""before tax incentives""."
7w64ms,"So if there are no tax incentives, you still pay $35,000."
7w64ms,"You may feel sad, or mad, or hurt that you haven't gotten your car."
7w64ms,I share your pain.
7w64ms,But the law doesn't exist to protect our feelings.
7w64ms,It exists to protect consumers from deliberate faleshoods.
7w64ms,"Until some new evidence surfaces, I'm going to continue to give Tesla the (legally-required!"
7w64ms,) benefit of the doubt and just keep wishing for that invitation to configure.
7w64ms,"In the mean time, let's collectively knock off the ""bad faith"" claims."
662kqm,"Tesla's open source patents strategy is great, is it effective?"
662kqm,"Some car companies might avoid using Tesla patents to protect their brand and maintain it's position and the perception of it in the consumers' minds, although the patents make Tesla cars reliable, efficient and very different."
662kqm,"If a company uses Tesla patents, they might experience consumer divergence as when people associate a car company with certain features, it might attract a different audience and so pressure the original consumer to change brand because they would't want to associate themselves with that new perception."
rv6mir,"FSD Beta 10.8 write up - Canadian Edition2017 Model X w/ AP 2.5 cameras  TL;DR - It works, but it's clunky."
rv6mir,Shit in snow  I recently went on a trip to Canada in my Model X.  At the beginning of the trip I drove up on 10.6.
rv6mir,"1, however, while I was up there FSD Beta 10.8 got pushed to my X via the LTE connection, so I installed it."
rv6mir,"A brief summary of the trip up using FSD Beta to do a 1,300 mile (Tampa, FL to Gatineau, QC - One way) road trip is ""I was faster""."
rv6mir,The main issue I'd run into with FSD Beta 10.6.
rv6mir,"1, and then 10.8, is that it brakes too much on on ramps that it makes it take longer for you to get to the end of the ramp, meaning that once I got on to the offramp it was faster for me to just take control of the vehicle and drive it to the destination (Charger or bathroom)."
rv6mir,"You'd think FSD Beta would help in making sure you follow a good path to the charger's location, but you'd be wrong."
rv6mir,In practice FSD Beta just got in the way as to was often too timid.
rv6mir,"Admittedly, I was set to ""Average"", but that's largely because I was going through areas that were unknown to me, so I didn't want the vehicle being assertive in areas where it turned out it shouldn't have been."
rv6mir,"Anyways, after two nights of driving I crossed the Canadian border in to Ontario and hauled ass for Ottawa."
rv6mir,"IF you saw a Model X driving around the Ottawa area with Florida plates, that was me."
rv6mir,I arrived at the Napean supercharger at around 1:53am on December 28th (FSD Beta 10.6.
rv6mir,1 at this point).
rv6mir,[This was the path the car routed for](https://imgur.com/Ytq1H88).
rv6mir,"The morning of February 28th it was snowing, FSD Beta was, more or less useless."
rv6mir,"The wind was enough that the snow was drifting across the pavement, making it hard for FSD Beta to get an eye on things."
rv6mir,"If a turn was involved, FSD Beta failed."
rv6mir,"If no turn was involved, it was fine, but I had to have a firm grip on the wheel as there was a lot of uncertainty ""wobbling"" due to a lack of lane markings in the snow."
rv6mir,*Why didn't you go straight on Moodie Dr?
rv6mir,*  Tesla's navigation said turn left.
rv6mir,"I came across [this sign](https://imgur.com/4O8dv7g) while trying to determine if I could go straight, my 2am tired brain couldn't handle it and opted to just turn left and follow the in car navigation."
rv6mir,"Ultimately though, FSD Beta wasn't reliable enough to attempt the turns, and barely reliable in a light dusting of snow."
rv6mir,"That being said, my cameras were also picking up salt and grime from the roads, so I was constantly running into issues with being able to turn the system on, by FSD/NoA functions were degraded due to visibility issues."
rv6mir,Once done charging I following [this path](https://imgur.com/2WxdPxl) to get to my destination.
rv6mir,Destination has been cut off.
rv6mir,"Again, because of the weather conditions, FSD Beta was somewhat unreliable."
rv6mir,"Once I got onto the 417 regular AP kicked in, and the roads had been ploughed/salted and I was able to rely on the system to get me to my exit."
rv6mir,"Note that I did this trip with all season tires, so one of the other issues I was running into was the Tesla not obeying winter driving rules, which is ""Keep a bigger following distance"" and ""Don't slam the brakes""."
rv6mir,Going across the bridge from Ottawa to Gatineau I had to disable regular AP because the snow drifting across the bridge was just confusing the thing and I was wobbling.
rv6mir,"Being that it was now 2:30am, I didn't want to end up in the river from the car being stupid, so I basically did the remainder of the highway driving by hand."
rv6mir,"As I got closer to my destination I came across [this intersection](https://imgur.com/oA3RH7a), which is a stop sign."
rv6mir,I had opted to use FSD Beta again because it was early and there was no traffic on the roads.
rv6mir,I wanted to see what would happen.
rv6mir,My direction of travel is indicated by the red arrow.
rv6mir,"The car appears to not even try to stop for the stop sign, or it was not going to stop in time at all."
rv6mir,"I had to slam on the brakes, which caused me to slide about 5-10ft into the intersection, due to the fresh snow on the ground."
rv6mir,"Suffice to say at that point I swore I wouldn't rely on FSD Beta to stop at stop signs reliably, and was more judicious in disabling it when I felt it necessary."
rv6mir,"While driving through the mountains of Virginia, or Pennsylvania, honestly can't remember, I picked up a [rock](https://imgur.com/JhN85BW) in my [windshield](https://imgur.com/5qn1u8j), as such I had to go visit the Ottawa service center to patch the glass (For those unaware I've had to take my Model X to the service center once a month since getting it in November of 2021, for a variety of reasons."
rv6mir,"So, this trip to the service center means that I had to take it in this month as well, keeping that streak going)."
rv6mir,The route taken was [this one here](https://imgur.com/g5wHQ9H).
rv6mir,"Had my Dad with me, so FSD Beta was used liberally, but carefully, as I was trying to demonstrate how it handled things."
rv6mir,"The roads had been freshly salted and ploughed for the trip, however, while I did have the ""Speed limit warning"" chime turned off, my Dad was still advising me every time I was over the limit, so I was fighting the preset I had that made the car go 5mph over the limit, which is 8km/h."
rv6mir,"*Change the preset*  I did, once the vehicle was stopped."
rv6mir,"Anyways, the main issues I kept running into were the vehicle not giving enough follow distance, and not minding the winter conditions."
rv6mir,"The cameras would get covered in grime, and it seemed to have a hard time telling the curb apart from the snow that had been ploughed into the curb."
rv6mir,The vehicle nearly curbed itself numerous times because it wasn't always able to make the determination properly.
rv6mir,[If we look at this image here](http://www.
rv6mir,effectspecialist.com/LuckyWeb/Lucky61.
rv6mir,"jpg) we can see that the snow kind of ""ramps"" up to the curb."
rv6mir,"*It felt* like the Model X was interpreting the ramp as the curb, and as such that it had the ability to take turn tighter because it could ""ramp up"", or something."
rv6mir,Like a curb on the [left side of this image](https://www.
rv6mir,bridjit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rolled-curbs.
rv6mir,png)  So I'd be constantly moving the vehicle away from it.
rv6mir,"In fact, at the end of my trip up there my parents gave me a review of the vehicle, as it had been the first time they'd seen it, or been in it, and ultimately my dad's comment was ""Too much waving back and forth"", which was largely me fighting FSD Beta from being an idiot."
rv6mir,"The next leg of the trip was [this one here](https://imgur.com/sRY2Ab7), which regular AP worked fine on, but FSD Beta just couldn't handle the snow."
rv6mir,The cameras were covered in grime.
rv6mir,Once I got to the charger I took out a [lens disposable lens cleaning wipe](https://www.
rv6mir,amazon.com/Zeiss-Pre-Moistened-Cleaning-Wipes-count/dp/B01E9NC2Z4) that I keep a supply of in the car and wipes down my cameras for the next portion of the trip.
rv6mir,Also bought windshield washing fluid that wouldn't freeze in the rain.
rv6mir,"(That's a whole other, terrifying/worrisome story that you can probably figure out on your own)  I began the [next leg of the trip](https://imgur.com/FLleOJn), which was FSD Beta heavy, however, was not the route the navigation system wanted to take, as such FSD Beta wasn't used."
rv6mir,"The route indicated is ""This is how the locals get around"" route."
rv6mir,"I'd turn on FSD Beta for a bit, but then my Dad would navigate me to another road that wasn't on the navigation, so I'd have to disengage and re-engage repeatedly."
rv6mir,"The cameras ended up with grime on them again, lane changes would start to fail, and the slop on the roads made braking unreliable."
rv6mir,"My dad fussed at me a lot for ""unsafe following"" and ""Late braking""."
rv6mir,"Once all that was done, driving for the day was complete."
rv6mir,"That night I got FSD Beta 10.8, so from this point on FSD Beta is 10.8  Each day of the trip the weather got warmer, snow melted, there was less slop on the roads, and FSD became more reliable not because of the update, but because the roads were better."
rv6mir,[This intersection](https://imgur.com/27XUrTH) is one we frequented.
rv6mir,"The initial left turn would always fail, however, it would always stop for the stop sign and then take the right, though often timid."
rv6mir,"When weather, and visibility, was good the system behaved."
rv6mir,"One of the other routes we took was [this one here](https://imgur.com/ws0KxmQ), again ignoring the route that the navigation had pulled up and instead being routed by my parents, FSD Beta wasn't used as much as I would have liked because it was constantly trying to reroute."
rv6mir,"The reason we were going with my parents routing instead of the vehicle routing is because the vehicle typically wants you to go through downtown Ottawa to get anywhere, which sucks balls."
rv6mir,The parkways are generally better from a traffic standpoint.
rv6mir,Plus they wanted to look at a couple things.
rv6mir,[This turn here](https://imgur.com/xt8YyNA) was taken pretty consistently well when I had it do it.
rv6mir,"I did, however, run into issues on the parkways because the speed limit signs were [not the standard black on white](https://www."

rv6mir,"8i8192) signs, but rather white on black signs."
rv6mir,The car was hit or miss on weather or not it picked up the speed limits properly off these signs.
rv6mir,"These signs have been like this for years though, so it's something they need to work through."
rv6mir,The [slight right and right turn here](https://imgur.com/vEyLUqp) were both ok.
rv6mir,The right turn often required me to hit the gas to make it go.
rv6mir,Pretty sure it's due to a [slight visibility issue](https://www.

rv6mir,"8i8192) there where it can't see things very well until it scoots far enough forward, but it isn't fast at doing that visibility creep."
rv6mir,"For this trip that was basically the last time FSD Beta got used, from then on it was making too many navigational mistakes, and with my mother in the vehicle that wasn't cutting it, so it was easier to drive manually."
rv6mir,I have a personal grip about how it behaved on the [Vanier Parkway](https://imgur.com/QP08gUW) during our return trip though.
rv6mir,"It made a lane change into the left lane, despite the final objective being necessary to be in the right lane."
rv6mir,The [left lanes at St. Patrick and Vanier](https://www.

rv6mir,"8i8192) are both left turn lanes, while the right lane is the only straight through lane."
rv6mir,"As I've said numerous times before, the system needs to be better at planning ahead."
rv6mir,"It lacks ""local region"" knowledge, in that a local knows ""This road gets congested up ahead, better to stay in this lane for an extra minute or so than risk not being able to get back into it"", which is the issue that would've occurred here."
rv6mir,"[This route](https://imgur.com/1f7Ffzf) was also taken, however, it also suffered the my parents telling me that the car's pathing was stupid, so I had to manually reroute it."
rv6mir,When FSD Beta was on it mostly behaved.
rv6mir,One issue encountered though was that while traveling in the right lane [on this road](https://www.
rv6mir,"google.com/maps/@45.4636671,-75.6999219,3a,75y,22.36h,89.54t/data=!"

rv6mir,8i8192) the car changed intro the left lane.
rv6mir,"Admittedly these multiple purpose/time of day lanes are going to be tricky in the long run, this was an unnecessary lane change that made things harder up the road as we had to do a right turn."
rv6mir,"It also was not going to brake in time for [this turn](https://imgur.com/Le9ANaO), requiring an intervention."
rv6mir,"The next leg of the trip was [this one here](https://imgur.com/OijUxxu), which fell to the same issues."
rv6mir,"Camera grime, sloppy roads."
rv6mir,"[This curve](https://imgur.com/mnvy60Q) was handled fine, which pleased me."
rv6mir,"If memory serves, [this one](https://imgur.com/fa4NdMc) I had to intervene on, though I can't fully recall why."
rv6mir,I think safety concerns about it misjudging oncoming traffic.
rv6mir,Most left turns I took manual control over so as to not stress my parents out.
rv6mir,"[This roundabout](https://imgur.com/OlPF9dI), and honestly most I came across, were not handled well."
rv6mir,"Too slow, too jittery, not enough certainty."
rv6mir,"[This route](https://imgur.com/NjHIgo1) was also taken, again a lot of parental ""The car's pathing is stupid, do this"" involved, however, when FSD Beta was enable it again ran in to visibility issues due to dirt and grime on the cameras."
rv6mir,"I had gotten to a point where I'd clean them every time I stopped, however, they'd get shit on like 5 minutes down the road."
rv6mir,"In most cases the right turns were fine, however, I'd have to hit the gas to get it to go, and left turns were too risky because it wasn't slowing down properly for the weather conditions."
rv6mir,"[This was the route taken to get home](https://imgur.com/UfyLqJi), again, a lot of manual interventions because the car's navigation was not optimal for ""lower risk of traffic""."
rv6mir,"To clarify, the arrows in [this diagram](https://imgur.com/kUoyDFF) were what Tesla was always recommending."
rv6mir,"Admittedly, yes, the road design is stupid."
rv6mir,"You have a major highway, Quebec Route 5 ending right in the middle of downtown Ottawa, then surface roading your way around."
rv6mir,Is the path shorter?
rv6mir,"Yes, but it's a stupid path that has a lot of lights, traffic, and stress."
rv6mir,"The parkway, at least for my family and I, tends to be preferred, despite it taking a little longer."
rv6mir,"*But with the release of full self driving, you won't be driving*  True, but that doesn't mean I want the car to always bring me in to stressful traffic scenarios if there's a less stressful one."
rv6mir,Having the ability to pick from a selectin of routes would be *super* nice so I could pick a less efficient one if it meant less stress.
rv6mir,"[This left turn](https://imgur.com/xfDcDh3) was typically taken fine, but I'd almost always have to intervene to get it into the right lane before the turn off to Rt 5."
rv6mir,"Ultimately though, the TL:DR up top is the most accurate."
rv6mir,"When it worked, it worked great, but the winter conditions, such as fresh snow, dirty cameras, and sloshy slop on the roads made it unreliable in a lot of cases."
rv6mir,"[This right turn](https://imgur.com/RnKNYQK), for example, was a simple one, but as discussed above about the car having issues with discerning between snow and curbs meant that it got *real* close to curbing [when taking the turn](https://www."
rv6mir,"google.com/maps/@45.4189293,-75.6777352,3a,75y,218.73h,67.29t/data=!"

rv6mir,"8i8192) (Also now realizing that Google Street Maps in Ottawa was apparently a couple of dudes on motorcycles, lol)."
rv6mir,"It's designed too well for ""perfect conditions"", which I get it *it's a beta*, but it also shows how much the product still has to grow, as using it reliably for winter driving is just a nope."
rv6mir,"It needs to brake sooner, but since it can't see a stop sign until like 800ft or so away, 800ft is often not enough room to brake in time to stop at the stop sign."
rv6mir,"The other issues I ran into, which are less FSD Beta issues as much as Vision issues in general were that rain completely nerfs the system."
rv6mir,Albeit hard rain on 10.6.
rv6mir,"1 is less bad than hard rain on 10.8, but there comes a point where the system starts to slow down too much in the rain and you yourself become the hazard because it just keeps slowing down and going too slow."
rv6mir,45mph in a 65mph when people are going 75 or higher is not safe.
rv6mir,A lot of the issues also stemmed from the back wash from vehicles after a fresh rain.
rv6mir,"I could be trying to pass a semi truck and the backwash from the truck blinds the cameras, and it goes ""Oh, slow down to 45mph"", which becomes unsafe, and you have to push through it, then it takes a bit to recover."
rv6mir,"There also seems to be two turn signal modes, at least on the pre-refresh Model S/X."
rv6mir,"If you half push the turn signal stalk it will assess the area and perform the lane change ASAP, however, if visibility is poor it will outright fail."
rv6mir,"If you push the turn signal stalk all the way down, and leave it down, the car appears to take longer to assess the adjacent lane and then change lanes, I don't have an issue with this, I just wanted to point it out."
rv6mir,"It does mean that you might have your signal on for like 5-10 seconds while the car waits for visibility, but once it gets it it will change lanes."
13qt0qc,"FYI, Legacy car's stalk can change FSD modes chill/normal/assertiveOn legacy cars, the stalk which previously controlled follow distance (1-6 numbering) now controls FSD assertiveness for those cars in FSD beta."
13qt0qc,"Spinning the stalk on my legacy Model S switches from ""chill"" to ""normal"" to ""assertive""."
13qt0qc,"It also brings up a UI on the screen that let's me easily hit the ""limit lane changes for this drive"" button without having to navigate the controls/autopilot menu."
13qt0qc,I'm very very happy I have stalks.
13qt0qc,I frikkin hate the new cars with no stalks.
161w8jp,Other Car Brands are Surpassing Tesla AutopilotI recently rented a 2023 Nissan Rogue from Hertz and did a road trip in Massachusetts.
161w8jp,"Let me tell you, this random rental car had a better lane keep/cruise control system than my Model Y's autopilot."
161w8jp,It wasn't aggressively braking in heavy Boston traffic.
161w8jp,The follow distance set to 1 was helpful in stop-and-go traffic and it was more assertive getting back up to the set cruise speed than Autopilot which accelerates at a grandma rate.
161w8jp,And no phantom braking.
161w8jp,It was miles better than Autopilot and felt more confident.
161w8jp,What's going on here?
161w8jp,Is Tesla aware that Nissan and other companies are putting these superior systems in their mid level vehicles?
1dmnt8u,"I can't be the only one that thinks v12 FSD is complete trash, can I?"
1dmnt8u,"And I don't mean ""oh the wiper blades are garbage"" I mean holy crap, this is some absolute complete trash that I can't believe Tesla would be so irresponsible as to release."
1dmnt8u,"Quite frankly, it's such hot garbage I feel like Tesla should be forced to recall it for safety reasons."
1dmnt8u,First: the auto speed limiter.
1dmnt8u,What in gods name is Tesla thinking with this garbage?
1dmnt8u,15+ mph over the limit?
1dmnt8u,And then no adjustments to speed limit changes without significant changes in road curvature?
1dmnt8u,I've had this  software almost **blow by school zones going 30mph over the limit**.
1dmnt8u,Dude!
1dmnt8u,Who the hell tested this and thought THAT was OK?
1dmnt8u,Second: the auto speed limiter.
1dmnt8u,"Why does this thing insist on either going way too slow, pissing everyone behind me off, or way too fast, riding the guy behinds me's ass and pissing \*her\* off?"
1dmnt8u,How is this thing incapable of keeping up with the flow of traffic and constantly bouncing back and forth?
1dmnt8u,Third: the auto speed limiter.
1dmnt8u,Why does this thing not obey my speed limiting settings *at all*?
1dmnt8u,"Why does changing between Chill, Normal, and Assertive not seem to do *anything* despite the fact that the help bubbles explain it's supposed to change how FSD does stuff?"
1dmnt8u,Speed limits are constantly wrong.
1dmnt8u,"I mean, horribly, consistently wrong."
1dmnt8u,"Oh, was that a junction sign?"
1dmnt8u,"Nope, that was actually a 3mph speed limit sign ..."
1dmnt8u,on the 55mph highway.
1dmnt8u,"Thanks, Tesla."
1dmnt8u,You absolutely worthless goobers.
1dmnt8u,**What the hell happened to lane keeping?
1dmnt8u,** This car used to be able to stick in the middle of the road.
1dmnt8u,Now it drives like my drunk uncle.
1dmnt8u,Apparently double yellow lines around blind curves are merely a suggestion**.
1dmnt8u,**  **The constant warnings about my cameras being blocked despite the fact that it's just dark out.
1dmnt8u,** Holy hell.
1dmnt8u,Do NOT drive this car at night without a constant flow of street lights around you.
1dmnt8u,"You'll end up with a string of annoying chimes that just nag at you constantly that the cameras are blocked - right until another car with its headlights drives by and then it's fine for about 5 seconds, before it nags at you again because it's just dark out."
1dmnt8u,"Holy crap, if there's one thing that Tesla engineers need to be drowned in a pool of sulfuric acid over it's this one thing."
1dmnt8u,The same issue occurs with weather detection.
1dmnt8u,My god.
1dmnt8u,"You either better be in perfect sunny southern California weather or in a goddamned hurricane, otherwise the Tesla has no real knowledge of what the hell is going on and will alert you about bad weather when you simply duck into a small valley and there's a bit of shade."
1dmnt8u,I can't believe these people want $99 per month for this trash.
1dmnt8u,"This is like someones Github project, not a product you'd actually pay for."
v2rzy5,Thoughts On FSD Beta 10.12.2?
v2rzy5,"Have a few drives under my belt and while the updated visualizations are much better, it just seems to be doing some strange mistakes it hasn't done before."
v2rzy5,"Additionally, it seems to be stopping late and hard and the steering is much more jerky at times for no reason."
v2rzy5,"Oh, I should note, I've been in the Beta since the first wider release."
v2rzy5,Thoughts?
zzgpqn,Raleigh Service Center is Woefully BadHad my car in service for that past week here is the tl;dr  * Raleigh Service Center service reps (the people you talk to either physically or over the app) are either under trained or not supervised.
zzgpqn,It seems they are given a free hand on how to handle that place with mixed results.
zzgpqn,* Specifically Valerie will not try and help you (especially if you are not under warranty).
zzgpqn,* The estimate for everything is one day and at the end of that day it will be another day until it gets done.
zzgpqn,* The system is set up so you are at their mercy in terms of planning you days * You can only communicate through email or app (text in the Tesla app).
zzgpqn,The lag in this communication method is usually hours.
zzgpqn,Calling the service center results in going to voicemail which if it is answered it is answered through the app.
zzgpqn,Here are the details.
zzgpqn,The BMW i series and Mercedes Benz EQ series are looking better and better.
zzgpqn,"\-----  I took my 2014 Model S to the Raleigh Service Center on December 26, 2022."
zzgpqn,I had a TPMS warning message that would not go away.
zzgpqn,This was the fifth time I have tried to get this fixed.
zzgpqn,"The last time I went in (July 2022) the fix lasted a day then the warning message came back, but also there was a loose bolt or screw somewhere in the dash that kept moving when I turned."
zzgpqn,"The previous appointments were fine - not good, not great."
zzgpqn,I am out of warranty so I understand that I will be paying for services.
zzgpqn,I appreciate the Uber credit as well.
zzgpqn,This time around I had quite possibly the **worst service appointment imaginable.
zzgpqn,To the point that I will most likely not be buying another Tesla.
zzgpqn,"**  The service rep that I was talking with was named Valerie, who said she was a senior service rep."
zzgpqn,Her first greeting to me was to tell me I am out of warranty and I would not be getting an Uber credit.
zzgpqn,Again this is fine I was aware as the app sent an auto message saying the same thing.
zzgpqn,I had already called a Lyft.
zzgpqn,I mentioned to her that one of the tires was losing 7 psi a day for the past 5 days and I had been filling it up since this appointment was coming.
zzgpqn,I had put it on the chat and requested she add it to the ticket.
zzgpqn,All good.
zzgpqn,That was Monday and both the app and Valerie said that work should be done by the end of the day.
zzgpqn,End of the day the work had not started and I was given an estimate for completion at the end of Tuesday.
zzgpqn,End of Tuesday Valerie called me and said the work was difficult and my car was old so they needed another service tech to work on it.
zzgpqn,I asked when the car would be done and she said it was maybe Wednesday or Thursday.
zzgpqn,"I requested a loaner since this was the fifth time they were trying to fix things, I had already spent $500 last time for this same fix and they already had the car for two days."
zzgpqn,This is when everything went off the rails.
zzgpqn,Valerie kept saying that my car was out of warranty and I would not get a loaner.
zzgpqn,She suggested that I trade in the car for parts and buy a new car as they have some kind of promotion going.
zzgpqn,**Sell a working car for a warning light.
zzgpqn,"** I told her that if I had known that it would take four to five days, I would have rented a car."
zzgpqn,"She said my car was old and the repair difficult, I mentioned that she knew on Monday this was the case."
zzgpqn,She again mentioned I was out of warranty.
zzgpqn,Fine I asked her if the tire pressure issue was on the ticket.
zzgpqn,She said they check the tire every visit.
zzgpqn,I again reiterate that my first chat message detailed the issue with the tire.
zzgpqn,Was that on the ticket?
zzgpqn,She said I should have put that in the original appointment on the app and not the chat.
zzgpqn,I did not remind her of our first discussion about this but asked her to put it on the ticket now which she said she would.
zzgpqn,I requested the name of a manager.
zzgpqn,I was given an email for Robert Garcia.
zzgpqn,Day 3.
zzgpqn,Emailed Robert and spelled out all that had happened.
zzgpqn,His response was terse but professional.
zzgpqn,He would make sure the TPMS warning light issue would be taken care of and I would get a loaner.
zzgpqn,So I sent a message to Valerie on the app requesting a loaner and also left a voice message.
zzgpqn,This was at 1pm.
zzgpqn,I received a message on the app at 5:10 pm that since it was so late they could not clean a car in time to give me a loaner as they close at 5pm.
zzgpqn,I emailed Robert with this update and requested the loaner in the morning.
zzgpqn,Day 4.
zzgpqn,Robert emails saying the vehicle is done and the TPMS issue resolved.
zzgpqn,Great.
zzgpqn,I emailed back asking if I can pick up the car as the app had not sent an updated estimate or a bill to accept.
zzgpqn,I also wanted to know if the wheel issue was taken care of.
zzgpqn,Valerie calls 11 am asking about the wheel issue.
zzgpqn,I again read her the very first chat message I had sent four days ago now detailing that there was an issue with the tire.
zzgpqn,She said I should have said tire and not wheel.
zzgpqn,Again I reiterated that in the chat and when I had spoken to her several times earlier I had said “tire” and wanted it put on the ticket.
zzgpqn,She again went into her script about being out of warranty and how I should use the app.
zzgpqn,"I simply requested her to have a tech look at the tire to see if there was a leak, if there was to replace the tire."
zzgpqn,If they could not get this done in one day I would come by now and pick up a loaner.
zzgpqn,She said her tech was out for lunch and would look at the tire at 1pm.
zzgpqn,"At 3 pm, I sent a string of emails to Robert, the app, and a voice mail at Tesla service."
zzgpqn,No replies.
zzgpqn,At 4pm I simply state in the app that I will be coming to pick up the car or a loaner.
zzgpqn,"On the Lyft ride there I get a message on the app saying that they close at 5pm, I am out of warranty and I will not get a loaner."
zzgpqn,I copy an image of that and email it to Robert.
zzgpqn,He emails back saying I should speak with Valerie to get a loaner as it seems the car is not complete.
zzgpqn,I get to the service station at 4:30.
zzgpqn,The only person working the counter is Valerie.
zzgpqn,I say hello and request either my car or a loaner.
zzgpqn,Here things go from bad to worse.
zzgpqn,Valerie comes through with all the things I have done wrong:  1.
zzgpqn,Why did I not come earlier?
zzgpqn,"(I had no communication from her, Robert or the app to come earlier)  2."
zzgpqn,You can't show up 30 minutes before closing expecting a loander.
zzgpqn,(If I had known to come earlier I would have).
zzgpqn,3.
zzgpqn,"I did not approve the estimate (I was never given an estimate, while we were speaking she sent an estimate and pointed to my phone saying see there it is, I told her I literally saw her just send it)."
zzgpqn,4.
zzgpqn,I need to talk to Robert not her (This is after she said Robert had left - so we both know he is not there.
zzgpqn,She was basically saying this is all Robert's fault and you need to take it up with him not me).
zzgpqn,5.
zzgpqn,Why had I not added the tire to the original ticket (that ticket was made by the service rep because the service before did not fix the problem).
zzgpqn,Each time I show her either the email or chat message or show her that I never received an updated estimate or message to come and get a loaner or my vehicle.
zzgpqn,She went over the estimate ($1500 to upgrade the harness - again I told her this is the fifth time and I had already paid last time and the initial estimate was $0).
zzgpqn,At every interaction she seemed to want to escalate.
zzgpqn,She would point things out that I had incorrectly and when given the email/app messages to the contrary would move to the next things.
zzgpqn,I am sad to say that I reached my limit at this point and went off for about 20 seconds.
zzgpqn,I told her that if they are competing with BMW/Mercedes/Lexus in terms of service they are not close (Valerie asserted that they were not competing against them by the way).
zzgpqn,She then told me the best she could do is get someone to fix the tire after hours and I could leave with my car.
zzgpqn,"During that time I emailed Robert, I got an automated message saying he had left for the day and would be back 01/03."
zzgpqn,"Finally another manager named Shawn came out, I gave him the synopsis."
zzgpqn,He said they would get the tire fixed and I would get my car.
zzgpqn,"I asked him what would happen, if as I am driving home,  the warning light pops back on."
zzgpqn,He gave me his cell number and said just call me if that happens.
zzgpqn,"As I waited for the tire to get fixed I introduced myself to every interested person picking up a Tesla in the showroom (they also need more sales associates as that now takes more than an hour), and told them my five appointment story about getting a warning light fixed."
zzgpqn,They are probably ok if under warranty and probably even more ok if they don't come to the Raleigh service center.
zzgpqn,"Finally got my car back after an hour, the loose screw noise was still present."
zzgpqn,"Called Shawn, he and I took a drive and he set up another appointment for Jan 24."
zzgpqn,In retrospect.
zzgpqn,Both Robert and Valerie are not good at working as a team to address customer issues.
zzgpqn,"Valerie is antagonistic, she is looking to get a reaction."
zzgpqn,"I am not sure if this is willful or her way of being ""helpful"" This service center is woefully inadequate for the amount of money you pay for the car."

qfwj20,1 FSDBeta drive setting experienceTime to burn tonight and just curious how others’ experiences broke down by the new FSD drive setting.
qfwj20,"Yes, I know it’s an overly simplified poll, do your best to select best fit."
qfwj20,Can only do 6 options leave comment if Aggressive setting sucked.

1d25scm,6 when I select assertive and speed offset.
1d25scm,1.
1d25scm,Sometimes I have noticed it goes back to normal from assertive so I have to manually put it back to assertive.
1d25scm,2.
1d25scm,Speed overset is not working on highways and I have to manually use the scroll wheel to adjust the speed any comments?

1bt6t21,3 Agressive Acceleration Hey Everyone!
1bt6t21,Just got the V12 update running 12.3.
1bt6t21,3 on my 22 MYLR.
1bt6t21,Love it so far other than the aforementioned speed issues.
1bt6t21,Does anyone have a problem with how quickly it accelerates off the line to the speed limit?
1bt6t21,I want to use FSD as much as possible but this driving style us incredibly inefficient and not comfortable for me or my passengers.
1bt6t21,"Should I leave a voice note for the FSD team with the ""autopilot disconnected, what happened""?"
1bt6t21,feature or is there a better way to send them feedback?
1bt6t21,Thanks  Kyle
15s0wtg,Someone in my apartment’s front office skipped science class.
15s0wtg,I back in to charge with the 120v outlet in my carport that management gave me permission and know I use.
15s0wtg,Gave me a chuckle seeing this on my windshield today
1bv641k,I had to give up FSD because they took away regular cruise control with fsd option active.
1bv641k,Unless am missing something ?
1bv641k,I really like FSD but  regular cruise control is what I use 90% cause it's a smooth ride with no surprises.
vfvsgv,Does supercharging your car multiple times really have a bad affect on the battery long term?
vfvsgv,"Hello Everyone,  I don’t have a place to charge my model 3 Tesla at my apartment and so I supercharge my car 1-2 times a week."
vfvsgv,I’ve seen so many people talk about only charging their car up to 80% but I have been going up to 90-100% and now I’m getting worried that this will affect my car.
128yxeu,Quick trip report report - Northern AZ to SoCal round tripJust got back from a road trip with my wife from my home in Northern AZ to downtown San Diego in my Model 3 Performance w/FSD Beta v11.3.
128yxeu,3.
128yxeu,Supercharging cost vs.
128yxeu,"gas cost - although I left my home with a 100% charge, my home charging costs are ridiculously low at $ 0.05 per kWh off-peak, so it’s negligible and I didn’t include this."
128yxeu,I only used Superchargers on the trip and didn’t use the heater or AC much.
128yxeu,Supercharger costs were $115.36.
128yxeu,"Using current AZ and CA average costs per gallon, a gas vehicle averaging 30 mpg would have paid approximately $148.96 in fuel."
128yxeu,It’s about what I expected; supercharging isn’t cheap but it’s cheaper than gas.
128yxeu,FSD behavior notes - v11.3.
128yxeu,3 really impressed me by how much improved it is vs.
128yxeu,FSD even a few months ago.
128yxeu,"In the city, it’s not hesitant."
128yxeu,"My setting is “assertive”, but the car will creep out to make right turns, and will make a left turn at a green light with an oncoming car visible; knowing it will complete the turn before the car arrives."
128yxeu,"Highway driving went well too, although a few times I had phantom braking in both FSD and AP."
128yxeu,"It seems to occur when the car approaches a slight hill, and also it seems to get fooled at the water “mirage” effect in the distance on the highway."
128yxeu,"I took it out of FSD a couple times on the highway as it was hugging the left lane’s outside line and made me nervous until I figured out that it would do this when I was passing a slower vehicle on the 2-lane highway and would hug the outside as I passed, especially semis."
128yxeu,"Night highway driving was fine too, but I got a warning that FSD performance would be degraded because of something (those notices turn off too quickly before you can read them IMO)."
128yxeu,The only head-scratcher was a bizarre moment when I’m heading to a SC that I know for sure I can make it easily.
128yxeu,"All of the sudden, the car slows down and tries to make get in the left lane to prepare for a u-turn, and the supercharger it now wants me to go to is back from the city I left nearly an hour ago."
128yxeu,I ignored that and took over and when I passed the u-turn point the nav re-calced and then pointed me to where I was going originally.
128yxeu,Weird.
128yxeu,"Also, FSD seems to change lanes randomly for some reason."
128yxeu,"For example, I had to make a a right exit off of the highway in a mile and I was already in the right lane."
128yxeu,"The car signaled and went into the left lane, and then less than a minute went back into the right lane to take the exit."
128yxeu,There was no traffic or other cars.
128yxeu,"Thanks for the read if you made it this far, and hope this helps!"
b9rsie,PSA for NoA: If it’s recommending lane changes too often make sure you’re not set to Mad MaxThis should be a sticky anytime NoA updates come out since we’re seeing so many posts about NoA suggesting too many lane changes.
b9rsie,"Mad Max DOES NOT make lane changes more assertive or aggressive, what is does do is suggest a lane change to overtake anyone going slower than the speed you set."
b9rsie,If you’re unhappy with how often NoA wants to change lanes to pass a car try setting it to “average” or even “mild”.
b9rsie,If anyone has had a different experience with these setting since the latest updates let us know.
aeb7ui,"Unusual conversation about Tesla with another EV ownerI encountered a Nissan Leaf owner today, we were both parking in a the EV area of my workplace."
aeb7ui,She saw me and asked how I liked my Tesla Model 3.
aeb7ui,I told her it is great.
aeb7ui,"She then stated ""It's just a smaller Model S, right""?"
aeb7ui,"I replied, uh, no, they're different cars."
aeb7ui,"She then reiterated her position that it's just a smaller Model S, using ""They look the same"" as her reasoning."
aeb7ui,"I replied, they're both Teslas, of course they might resemble each other."
aeb7ui,"Then she said ""But they both have a battery and a computer; they're the same""."
aeb7ui,"I replied that two BMW models might both have engines and steering wheels, but that hardly makes them ""the same"" vehicles."
aeb7ui,"Undeterred, she then continued on her line of reasoning, re-asserting that the Model 3 is just a smaller Model S. I replied with another analogy about Chevrolet making different cars, but that doesn't mean they're the same car."
aeb7ui,At this point we approached the doors to the building.
aeb7ui,I went ahead and walked slightly faster so I wouldn't have to talk to her anymore.
aeb7ui,"I'm not sure if she was just trying (and failing) to make small talk, was trying to criticize Tesla somehow, or was just massively mis-informed, but whatever it was, she wouldn't take my assertion that ""They're different cars""."
aeb7ui,Weird.
xyh3dx,"Finally got into FSD betaOTA was actually a little earlier in the week, but as it's actually the wife's kid hauler car, we didn't get to enable and try it out until today after work."
xyh3dx,I like to say that this is the first day we've gotten our full money's worth for the purchase price of the car (after more than 5 years of ownership).
xyh3dx,We tried it on the drive back home from the restaurant.
xyh3dx,"Overall, very impressive, though we had a few interventions."
xyh3dx,"And on one occasion, it pulled into a turn lane one block too soon, not sure what it would have done."
xyh3dx,Try to move back at the green?
xyh3dx,Take the wrong turn and re-route?
xyh3dx,"I'm frankly amazed at how aggressive/assertive it is; probably needs some getting used to, but it drives more aggressively than I do."
xyh3dx,Maybe it's just nerves due to first attempt.
banmbg,"Wouldn’t it be cool if we can give preparatory commands to NOA just to train it better“”Stay on this lane” - does not Mad Max  “Prepare to exit” - starts to make maneuvers to get on the eventual lane needed to exit  “Move to fast lane”  “Move left”  “Move right”  “Passive merge” - falls back to a merge  “Assertive merge” - speeds up to a merge  “Cancel exit” - cancels NOA, falls back to regular Lane Keeping”  “Station Keeping Mode” - stays in the flow of traffic, does not exceed standard deviation of speed relative to surrounding cars  “Dis/Activate audible” - turns audibles on or off"
6yy91t,"[Discussion] on measuring battery capacity/power in kilowatts instead of megajoulesThe watt is a confusing unit for me (and I'd bet most consumers) because it has time already factored into it, whereas the joule does not."
6yy91t,"Time being part of the unit breaks my ability to think of electricity as a fluid, like gas, that ""flows"" into my ""tank""."
6yy91t,"If I wanted to know how long it's going to take me to fill up a gas tank, I would expect to see gallons per hour."
6yy91t,"When I want to know how long it's going to take me to charge my battery, I want to see kilowatts per hour."
6yy91t,But that's wrong.
6yy91t,"Chargers are measured with kilowatts, because the ""per hour"" is already part of the watt unit."
6yy91t,So counterintuitive!
6yy91t,"Likewise, it's confusing that my battery holds some amount of watts ""an hour""."
6yy91t,"My battery should just hold X number of units, my brain doesn't intuitively understand what time has to do with it."
6yy91t,"If batteries were measured in megajoules, the units would all make more sense."
6yy91t,"A level 2 charger is 20 MJ/h, so if your battery ""holds"" 200MJ then it will take you 10 hours."
6yy91t,So much more intuitive.
6yy91t,"And lastly, just in terms of unit choices, the watt makes most sense when you want to know how much energy you're _using_, but the joule makes more sense when you want to know how much energy something _contains_."
6yy91t,"You can obviously use kWh to measure contained energy and Joule-hours for how much is being used, but that seems like measuring a gas tank with the unit gallons per hour * hour."
6yy91t,Did Tesla do market research and find that people understood kW units better?
6yy91t,Or was it just because it was easier for the engineers to think of things in terms of kW and that leaked into public info?

1bvt8t5,FSD Supervised First Impression.
1bvt8t5,Wow!
1bvt8t5,Model 3 P 2022I just got the update to the latest V12.
1bvt8t5,X version.
1bvt8t5,this week.
1bvt8t5,"Been working at home so no need to go out, and when I had to it was late and raining hard."
1bvt8t5,I had used the prior 11.
1bvt8t5,X vintage for long trips mostly.
1bvt8t5,"tI was OK, like really good cruise control."
1bvt8t5,Street/City driving was a party trick.
1bvt8t5,"This version I just tried out on a short drive home from the grocery store, at lunch time, in northern New Jersey."
1bvt8t5,It handled some of the most difficult and sketchy driving I have ever seen.
1bvt8t5,I live off a main road that cuts from two lanes to one just before my turn off on the right.
1bvt8t5,And another lane merges into it from the right just as the merge comes on.
1bvt8t5,Its nuts for a human.
1bvt8t5,You have to spend 90% of your vision in the rear view wondering who is on a cell phone and going to smack into you.
1bvt8t5,The car put itself into the right lane before the merge.
1bvt8t5,It saw the traffic from the right and noticed the volume to the left and my turn coming.
1bvt8t5,"It literally sped up to ensure its place in the road, and only for a moment did a quick slow-down/speedup for like 1/2 a second as we approached merging cars from the right."
1bvt8t5,"Then as we approached my turn, while the two lanes went to one, it put on its blinker, slowed a bit, but hooked the turn like a pro probably at 8 mph  I am taking it out later on - I need to try this some more."
1bvt8t5,"The only thing I come away with is it drives like I would, maybe even more assertive."
1bvt8t5,I also had it in assertive mode.
1bvt8t5,This is MUCH different than prior to 12 - WOW!
1bvt8t5,&#x200B;
1cd3aqx,FSD Too Human-like?
1cd3aqx,"Overall I’m reasonably impressed after weeks of my FSD trial, but three seemingly easy things are consistently screwed-up IMO."
1cd3aqx,"Frustratingly, they seem to be exactly what annoying human drivers do: 1) Slows down BEFORE moving into the exit lane getting off a highway 2) Not getting up to proper highway speed BEFORE getting on a highway (embarrassing considering the pick-up that a Tesla has!"
1cd3aqx,) 3)  Staying in the left lane long after passing someone.
1cd3aqx,"Like I get all the challenges in making a car drive itself, but these should not be where it struggles!"
1cd3aqx,This should be the easy part.
1cd3aqx,Or are the programmers just poor drivers who camp in the left lane and get on and off highways at 45?
12btj82,FSD 11 changes to right scroll wheelNoticed the car length option changed to driving type options under Autopilot settings.
12btj82,So long car following distance.
1donvp9,FSD: Autopilot Disabling X TimesIs there any way to reset the X times autopilot has been disabled?
1donvp9,This is messed up.
1donvp9,That means one more incident and it will be disabled for a whole week.
1donvp9,"Since I am paying the monthly subscription for FSD, that results in a loss of $25 for a week."
1donvp9,That’s not right.
1donvp9,I’m paying for this.
1donvp9,I should have that week extended before my subscription renews.
1donvp9,I had to make a long trip recently but it had disabled for a whole week on me.
1donvp9,FSD could have really helped when I was driving that 1k mile trip up north.
1donvp9,"I have been using it without incident so there should be a rule:  - after so X days without incident, the X times disabled reduced should be reduced by 1 until it gets back to 0  Anyone?"
165kvv4,To Chill Mode or Not to Chill Mode - That Is The Question?
165kvv4,Just wondering if I'm the only one who enjoys Chill Mode more as of late versus Standard > Sport > Insanity > Ludicrous.
165kvv4,"Now, some 3 years into my Tesla journey, and having had a lot of seat miles in all 4 models (all dual-motors so that does play a factor), I find that I enjoy having the car set to 'Chill Mode' mode acceleration more than I do any of the other options for most everyday and highway driving."
165kvv4,"I've driven plenty of other cars with driver selectable ""nerfed"" power settings for economy, relaxed mode, or new driver mode in their de-rated power modes, and generally what you get is car the feels wonky."
165kvv4,"Anywhere from feeling like it's not getting enough fuel, to feeling like the pedal is dead, to throwing itself into higher/highest gears as soon as possible."
165kvv4,Not the case with the Tesla.
165kvv4,"The more I drive in this setting, I find that Tesla's programmers did an excellent job of calibration for this mode."
165kvv4,"The experience feels more akin to an \[Insert German V8 luxury car here\] where strength of the motor gives effortless thrust, but it is delivered in a controlled, firm and positive push versus and the assertive slaps of power of you get on throttle tip-in in Tesla's other acceleration modes."
165kvv4,"Chill definitely takes the edge off the frenetic pace and what can feel like a step-function response on the throttle application, without neutering the car."

128wvki,Anyone ran into this since the newest update?
128wvki,"(2022.45.13)I've played around with every slider and option while in park and no matter what I do, I can't get it to allow me to change the offset (or set speed) to fixed mode when in the full self-driving beta."
128wvki,Even stranger that it will let you change the percentage offset but not change to fixed.
128wvki,Maybe a glitch?
128wvki,I've been in the FSB beta for almost a year and a half and never had an issue until this update with any of these menus.
1cw5wb5,FSD slams brakes at yellow lights when there’s more than enough time to drive through themAny fix for this besides pushing down the accelerator to force it to continue?
1cw5wb5,I have it on Chill setting.
13rupir,Does your FSD run Red lights?
13rupir,I’m on 2022.45.15 and in the last two weeks Car has tried to go over Red.
13rupir,"It comes to a full stop and than creeps in, over red, just like it would be a 4 way stop."
13rupir,Anyone else experienced this?
17wgbct,How well does FSD do with lane/passing laws?
17wgbct,"Just curious, I got a M3 a couple months ago and absolutely love it but haven’t tried FSD."
17wgbct,In my state vehicles are required to ‘keep right except to pass’.
17wgbct,"Unfortunately many people don’t follow this law, but I was curious how well FSD does with this."
17wgbct,"A few specific questions:  If you’re on a 3+ lane freeway, will it merge all the way to the right lane or stay in the middle lanes when there are no other cars around?"
17wgbct,"If someone is driving very slowly in the left lane, will it pass on the right?"
17wgbct,Thanks!
1cmko8b,Is there a way to turn down acceleration?
1cmko8b,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the pushing my head into the chair power that the car has!"
1cmko8b,"But I have it on chill mode, with relaxed steering, and chill FSD and it still feels like a drag race at every green light or stop sign."
1cmko8b,"Is there a way to adjust the acceleration numbers associated with chill, normal, assertive?"
1cmko8b,I feel like there would be decent gas savings and longer tire life if it wasn't trying to win a race at every takeoff.
1cmko8b,If there's a car coming that's different.
1buj0t5,Holy sh*t FSD is the most aggressive driver I have seenBeen trying out FSD more since the free trial.
1buj0t5,I swear on assertive it's a mad man.
1buj0t5,It was during rush hour and I set it on assertive to see if it can maybe speed up through traffic and yes it did.
1buj0t5,"Aggressive acceleration check, tailgating check, trying to swerve through lanes to avoid cars going the speed limit also check."
1buj0t5,I was scared yet impressed to see the balls FSD has.
1buj0t5,It even had to use its own corrective steering assist when it tried to accelerate and try to change lanes into a car approaching quickly.
1buj0t5,The craziest part of this to make it true is the energy consumption which normally is 250Wh for me is now 305Wh which is mind boggling
1dufjlg,FSD Highway exit - too aggressive?
1dufjlg,I feel like FSD is too aggressive even in the least assertive chill mode for highway exits.
1dufjlg,"Instead of easing off the highway, it waits a little longer than I would to leave the travel lane, and does a sort of jerky 'S' maneuver into the exit lane, similar to a race car changing lanes aggressively."
1dufjlg,"It's a little unsettling because i wonder if I need to take over, my passenger is looking at the exit lane wondering why we're still going straight."
1dufjlg,Everyone kinda freaks when the car finally exists or even if I take over...
1dufjlg,Do you think chill mode is chill enough?
1dufjlg,Btw I find the chill mode fine for regular lane changes on the highway.
1dufjlg,What do you think?
1dufjlg,Should there be a super chill mode?
1buanmc,FSD - It was like an enigma until I tried it and I now feel is just meh.
1buanmc,Is that Just me?
1buanmc,Plus the near accidents & multiple honks I got.
1buanmc,More details below.
1buanmc,"I had set the FSD mode as - average / assertive, but similar results overall."
1buanmc,I live in a less congested suburb with higher than normal speed limits even in Surface roads (50 MPH is very common).
1buanmc,I went through the below 3 incidents in these surface roads.
1buanmc,1.
1buanmc,"Car was going straight, when the lights turned to Yellow, when the car was less than 100 ft from the intersection."
1buanmc,"The car was going at 52 MPH & hit the brakes rather than going past the intersection, and the car behind me almost crashed into me."
1buanmc,"Thanks to empty roads, he honked and overtook me, while safely crossing the intersection."
1buanmc,2.
1buanmc,"The car is in a dedicated & protected right only lane (the right lane leads into the right most lane of the crossing road, wherein the right lane still remain protected for over 200 Ft)."
1buanmc,The traffic light turns Red & there was no other car or passenger in sight.
1buanmc,The car came to a grinding stop and wouldn't move.
1buanmc,"The only car nearby was behind me & he started honking at me, for not moving."
1buanmc,3.
1buanmc,I was in a surface street with 35 MPH speed limit.
1buanmc,The car reached a 4 way stop & there was no other car in the intersection.
1buanmc,"But the car wouldn't start after 4-5 seconds and I had take control to move as I didn't know if/when car will move, and I got honked once again."
1buanmc,Is this normal?
1buanmc,"In addition to this, the car randomly came to a complete stop while driving on a 65 MPH Freeway, while cruising at around 70 MPH, with moderate traffic all around."
1buanmc,The lane in which the car was traveling was empty at least for .
1buanmc,"25 miles and there were cars within few hundred feet in the 2 neighboring lanes all driving at similar speeds, but none had swerved or turned on turn signals to indicate any interference."
1buanmc,The car still decided to come to stop randomly & I took control to avoid being rear ended.
1buanmc,"I see every time I take control, there is a message on screen asking to press the right wheel button on steering to submit response."
1buanmc,"As of now, I haven't been able to do that, as I'm usually in a panic every time this has happened and by the time I feel safe again, the message is gone."
1buanmc,"Overall, I like the Auto-pilot & TACC over FSD till now."
1buanmc,"So, is that just me or is anyone else feeling the same?"
1bvuhc8,A must for FSD to turn onIf you want a middle aged human like driver.
1bvuhc8,It'll drive over speed limits and do relatively aggressive merges and turns.
1bvuhc8,Merges are perfect but some of the turns may be a bit too fast.
1bvuhc8,Your choice and responsibility to supervise it.
17oc3fl,Question about “always be charging”So my wife can charge our new Y at work for free.
17oc3fl,Fairly slow level 2 but over 8 hours charges about 60% of battery easily getting us to 80-85%.
17oc3fl,Free.
17oc3fl,"We are about to get a new nema 14-50 outlet installed home for backup situations (some weekends, vacation)."
17oc3fl,We have mobile connecter and have used trickle once or twice.
17oc3fl,"But then I see Tesla recommends to always leave it charging, esp cold weather."
17oc3fl,We live cold.
17oc3fl,"But we don’t want to charge it home, as free at work."
17oc3fl,We having been taking it down to like 40% from 85% during a weekend and then just recharge on Monday at work.
17oc3fl,We have not been plugging in at home cept couple trickle charges when got real low.
17oc3fl,.
17oc3fl,"Question:  can I set limit at home to like 30%, plug in over weekend (when it’s well above 30%) and still get the ABC benefit (like keep battery warm during winter I think)?"
17oc3fl,Or is there a real benefit to “topping it off” and we should charge it back to 85% even if we have to pay for it at home?
17oc3fl,Wife is refusing to plug in at all at home and it’s driving me nuts!
1bs1pta,"I have Full Self Driving Beta Version 12 but Would Like to Enable Autosteer Instead, Can I?"
1bs1pta,With FSD Beta version 12 I am forced to use a single pull for autopilot activation and can’t figure out how to enable auto-steer instead of FSD while driving.
1bs1pta,Before the single pull update rolled out and I was on FSD Beta v.11 I was able to do this no sweat.

mbetme,Serious: What is Tesla's exposure if FSD doesn't make it to owner's hands?
mbetme,"This might not be the right forum, but I'm curious if anyone has done a semi-academic study of the legal and financial exposure to Tesla and perhaps Elon himself if the FSD continues to push?"
mbetme,I understand that is a complicated question because Tesla itself isn't overly forthcoming and the reasons for pushing could vary wildly from bugs to government intervention.
mbetme,"I'm often chastised by other owners for taking a serious rather than optimistic view on the company, but it seems to me that the FSD presales constitute a contractual obligation for a specific set of features and that at some point the failure to deliver on those promises is a breach of contract subject to not just refunds, but perhaps penalties and other legal action."
mbetme,"I bring this up because I've spent the last two days in heated debate over Ford's ""vaporware"" comment with others in the community that take a more optimistic (perhaps apologetic) view point and it concerns me deeply that the ongoing delays are no longer just a customer service issue and matter of irritation for those of us early adopters, but perhaps a very real liability and risk to the company."
mbetme,"It also seems like an opportunity for competitors (I'm thinking more GM than Ford) to sling mud and make it stick, putting brand trustworthiness in the market in jeopardy."
mbetme,I welcome all honest and thoughtful comments.
mbetme,Thank you.
mbetme,&#x200B;  Updates: I'm updating here rather than inline to provide additional questions in an easy to find location.
mbetme,Update 1:  I've seen a lot of arguments here and other places that Tesla has no exposure legally due to the purchase contract wording.
mbetme,I assert this is patently false.
mbetme,"While Elon's public comments don't have the same legal weight as original contracts, as head of the company he has legal obligations to conduct himself as an honest representative of the company in both a marketing and a shareholder fiduciary level (read shareholder legal action, not buyer)."
mbetme,"Second, it is well documented that the original ordering forms (I'm thinking in the 2019 time frame) included very specific verbiage about both the capabilities of FSD and the time frame for delivery."
mbetme,"You can quibble about the what part of that, but not the when."
mbetme,"While there is no specific timeline on the contracts, the fact that the software is not transferable actually works against them legally because there is established law that puts limits on open-ended obligations (I'm looking into the exact statutes)."
mbetme,"To my way of thinking, the limits here are changes of ownership and the reasonable service life of the vehicle."
mbetme,Tesla could perhaps render this moot by allowing transfers.
mbetme,"Regarding the financial liability, it seems that it has been established that Tesla does carry the full value of the sales as a future liability on the books, but that just means they acknowledge it as a risk, not that the money is actually escrowed somewhere to pay it."
mbetme,"I don't think the actual numbers here are public knowledge (prove me wrong if you can find this), but it seems like it would be a large and potentially impactful number if it had to actually be produced."
mbetme,"Update 2:  There is a lot of opinion about the legal impact of the webpage, contract, and Elon's tweets."
mbetme,To date I can't say that anyone has actually backed that up with credentials or case law.
mbetme,"If you have that, I request you provided it."
mbetme,"If its just your lay-person legal opinion, let's not create contention by debating non-expert opinion."
mbetme,Update 3:  There have been some well-considered arguments that the way that Tesla is handing the bookkeeping on this potentially gives them SOME cover on level of financial exposure to buyers should the product not be brought to market complete.
mbetme,I'm investigating the specifics of that but legally there maybe merit.
mbetme,The level of cover seems highly depending on the court's interpretation of completeness and if they feel partial delivery is sufficient or if this is an all or nothing situation (Can they give you a 90% refund if they provided you with tires and a seat or is the deemed a useless and therefore zero-value delivery?
mbetme,).
mbetme,"It has also been noted that there has been a bit of talk lately about the potential involvement of regulators in two aspects: First, it is reasonable to think that regulators at state and federal levels both could stomp on deliveries at just about any time."
mbetme,"Second, there is inconsistency in the way the product is being marketed, the way the contracts read, and the way it is being described to regulators."
mbetme,This adds credibility to the fraud/false advertising angle.
mbetme,Update 4:   Pivotal Marketing (A major Tesla short seller) has recently released an updated video outlining a large portion of what we've been talking about here the last few days.
mbetme,"I argue that it is deliberately slanted and alarmist, but it does accurately portray the timeline and arguments contained in this thread and other places."
mbetme,[https://video.

kgxsp7,"Cybertruck ""Design"" is not optionalTesla is disrupting the car market with electrification that no one thought was possible."
kgxsp7,"They want to do the same for the pickup market, but truck buyers are loyal to their brand like a sports fan and openly hostile to any other brand."
kgxsp7,"To break that lock-in, Tesla must offer cost, power and range that are unmatchable."
kgxsp7,"Unfortunately, a lot of the ""news"" about the Cybertruck has been concept art designed by someone who doesn't understand the manufacturing and material constraints for the Cybertruck."
kgxsp7,I'm NOT here to complain.
kgxsp7,"In fact, I would love to see more concept art that Tesla could actually consider."
kgxsp7,That's why I want to educate people about the manufacturing and material constraints for the Cybertruck in simple terms that don't require Sandy Munroe's education to understand.
kgxsp7,"There's a key number to remember:  $40,000."
kgxsp7,That's the base price for the Cybertruck and it undercuts the most popular full-sized pickups.
kgxsp7,"At this time, it's well-known that Tesla's cheapest trim level never lasts more than a couple months for each model, and I don't expect that $40,000 Cybertruck to be sold for very long."
kgxsp7,That doesn't change the need to minimize costs.
kgxsp7,This is critical to overcoming the assertion that electric vehicles are too expensive.
kgxsp7,"So, Tesla has to cut costs in every way they can find to support that price point."
kgxsp7,"Tesla's battery technology helps here, because they're hitting $100 per kWh before anyone else in the industry."
kgxsp7,Tesla's mechanized manufacturing process and online ordering help too.
kgxsp7,The machines pay for themselves many times over.
kgxsp7,"In the future, we'll see how utterly impractical it is to use employees to build and sell cars, because Tesla is leading the way now."
kgxsp7,"To go one step farther, Tesla has selected stainless steel for the surface of the Cybertruck."
kgxsp7,This eliminates the need for a paint shop.
kgxsp7,Tesla had many fires in the paint shop and many customer complaints that the paint was spotty.
kgxsp7,"Honestly, they aren't very good at paint, so this is a big deal."
kgxsp7,The target market for full-sized trucks expects a hard-working truck that can take a beating.
kgxsp7,Stainless steel creates a strong impression of durability which is great.
kgxsp7,Tesla went one step farther to simplify the construction of the cybertruck and used a load-bearing skin.
kgxsp7,This seems to escape the attention of many designers (and design students) who want to eliminate that simple triangular shape.
kgxsp7,The entire body is a load-bearing truss to distribute the weight of the truck and its cargo to the wheels.
kgxsp7,"Triangles are critical to making trusses and making the whole vehicle one big triangle is the simplest, most efficient way."
kgxsp7,They had to make one more change to make that load-bearing skin work.
kgxsp7,The skin is much thicker than most automotive bodies.
kgxsp7,"This adds strength and durability, but it has a big drawback."
kgxsp7,"Modern cars use all kinds of crazy, cool-looking curves and design elements that are possible because of the stamping process."
kgxsp7,This stretches and bends the steel in complex ways.
kgxsp7,"As Elon famously said, the thick stainless steel sheets for the cybertruck would break any existing stamping machine."
kgxsp7,"That's okay though, because Tesla can save money by NOT using stamping machines."
kgxsp7,"Machines to fold the steel are much cheaper, faster and the result is stronger."
kgxsp7,Folded steel is never going to look like a modern automotive design.
kgxsp7,It adds up to a significant cost savings.
kgxsp7,It creates a lighter-weight vehicle which improves range.
kgxsp7,It's stronger which improves handling and hauling.
kgxsp7,"And it creates a new, iconic design that establishes Cybertruck as a unique brand that will not be mistaken for  anything else."
kgxsp7,"If you come up with some cool-looking modification it has to take those constraints into account, or it's just a fantasy of a completely different vehicle."
kgxsp7,It is NOT news.
1d0d8kr,"When FSD removes the need for user controls, will it always stay at/below speed limit?"
1d0d8kr,Would customers be ok with cybercab always staying within speed limit or would that frustrate them on certain roads?
1d0d8kr,Technically tesla can incorporate speed limit logic into their chill/assertive FSD setting but would that be approved by regulators?
1d0d8kr,"My guess is that they are trying to get that approval: namely, to have the car decide to exceed speed limit in certain cases (road is clear, visibility is good, etc)."
1cdy71l,FSD slow and lugging along?
1cdy71l,I feel like this last trial of FSD that was pushed out is strange.
1cdy71l,I’ve seen posts here talking about how it’s too heavy on acceleration and that even “chill” mode is intense but I can’t help but feel the opposite.
1cdy71l,When I’m driving a country road and the speed limit is 35 and I’ve set FSD to 45….
1cdy71l,it’ll roll along at like 30.
1cdy71l,Like… what gives?
1cdy71l,?
1cdy71l,There have been so many times I get annoyed and it’s moving along at a snail’s pace.
1cdy71l,I feel like the speed setting was pretty accurate before.
1cdy71l,Then when I’m entering a roundabout it’ll slow down and then suddenly accelerate into the thing going 30.
1cdy71l,That’s the only time I’ve noticed it be overly “assertive”.
1cdy71l,Anyone else have this experience?
1c1eqh4,FSD on M3 Refresh/Highland!

1c1eqh4,!
1c1eqh4,Today is the day!
1c1eqh4,!
1c1eqh4,I’ve been impatiently awaiting my word on FSD for the m3 refresh but here it is!
14umkh9,FSD Beta 11.4.
14umkh9,"5 - Improved short-deadline lane changes, to avoid going off-route, through better modeling of target lane vehicles to improve gap selection assertiveness."
14umkh9,- Improved offset consistency when controlling for static obstacles.
14umkh9,Also improved smoothness when changing offset direction by adjusting speed more comfortably.
14umkh9,- Improved handling of oncoming cars on narrow unmarked roads by improving prediction of oncoming car's trajectory and leaving enough room for them to pass before re-centering.
14umkh9,- Improved Occupancy Flow prediction from the Occupancy Network for arbitrary moving obstacles by 8%.
14umkh9,"- Expanded usage of the new object ground truth autolabeler for the NonVRU detection model, improving distant vehicle recall and geometry precision for semi-trucks, trailers, and exotic vehicles."
14umkh9,- Improved VRU control by expanding planning scope to control gently for low-confidence detections that may interfere with ego's path.
14umkh9,- Improved handling for VRUs near crosswalks by predicting their future intent more accurately.
14umkh9,This was done by leveraging more kinematic data to improve association between crosswalks and VRUs.
14umkh9,- Improved ego's behavior near VRUs by tuning their assumed kinematic properties and utilizing available semantic information to classify more accurately their probability of intersecting ego's path.
14umkh9,- Improved Automatic Emergency Braking recall in response to cut-in vehicles and vehicles behind ego while reversing.

1bhzrwz,Is anyone else's FSD 12 slow?
1bhzrwz,Just got FSD 12 and starting to test it out.
1bhzrwz,"First thing I've noticed is it is cruising consistently below the speed limit, like annoyingly so."
1bhzrwz,"I noticed the new 'Automatic Speed Offset' and changed it from Chill to Average, which was a little better but still not what I was used to with my 10% Offset."
1bhzrwz,"Don't really want to go to Assertive, so switched back to the set offset."
1bhzrwz,That too is driving slower than it used to before 12.
1bhzrwz,"Has anyone else had this issue, or am I missing a configuration somewhere?"
1bhzrwz,"Update (3/31/24): I have tried Assertive, which is better, but still won't meet my set speed in many areas."
1bhzrwz,"I can understand this behavior with the Automatic Speed Offset, but don't understand why it's doing it with a set offset."
1bhzrwz,"For the most part FSD is unusable for me because of this issue, which is sad because I really enjoyed using it before and haven't gotten to really experience version 12."
1bhzrwz,:(  Update (4/13/24): Just got and tested Update 2024.3.
1bhzrwz,"15, and it is much better!"
1bhzrwz,"There are still a few situations it doesn't reach the set speed like I think it should, but overall it is usable."
1bhzrwz,Thank you Tesla!
1dr1vbu,I just started my FSD trial today.
1dr1vbu,What are the best settings?
1dr1vbu,"It did good on city streets: going to the carwash, going to the grocery store."
1dr1vbu,It stopped well at all the lights and stop signs.
1dr1vbu,Was good about waiting for cars before pulling out onto streets.
1dr1vbu,Changed lanes to turn with plenty of time.
1dr1vbu,It was a nightmare on my commute to work.
1dr1vbu,There’s construction at all the ramps to the highways.
1dr1vbu,It would try to pass the ramps and tried to steer me into the construction site entrance instead of the on ramps.
1dr1vbu,"I was trying to set my traveling distance because it was following too closely, and I saw that that control has changed to how “assertive” the FSD was."
1dr1vbu,"I tried the Chill (I think it was called) on the way to work, and the Assertive on the way home."
1dr1vbu,"The chill kept me switching lanes often in the slower lanes, and the assertive kept me in the fast lane with less lane changes."
1dr1vbu,It was slow to move over into the exit lanes and I had to compete to get over right before the exits.
1dr1vbu,It didn’t acknowledge cars merging from the ramps and often positioned me in their blind spots.
1dr1vbu,"So, what’s the best overall?"
1dr1vbu,I found on Autopilot that chill mode works best to not be so jerky of a ride.
1dr1vbu,What are some of the tricks with FSD?
15anb0l,My wife is quite paranoid about the battery level...
15anb0l,"We only use about 10-15% battery each day on average, but she wants to top it up everyday to 90‰..."
15anb0l,"""You never know when you might need it"", she says."
15anb0l,"While I'm okay with topping up daily, I was wondering if I need to discharge the battery once in a while.."
15anb0l,like down to 20% or so?
15anb0l,Or is it healthy to maintain 60 and above at all times?
17eu7yp,Is it just me?
1buvpqw,"FSDS steering good, but speed is poor."
1buvpqw,First time trialed FSDS on a 600 road trip From Colorado to Arizona yesterday.
1buvpqw,"Mostly 2 lane open road, curvey and hilly, some highway, small towns and one city."
1buvpqw,Great sunny day.
1buvpqw,Clean car and cameras.
1buvpqw,I was impressed with the auto steering and navigation.
1buvpqw,"Lane changes, turns, exits, stops and starts while more jerky than me was good."
1buvpqw,"One thing I really liked is that it moved over to the right, off center, on the 2 lane roads when a car or large truck was passing by, something I have always wished Auto Steer did."
1buvpqw,No real issues other than it ran over a dead skunk that I would have missed.
1buvpqw,Also pothole areas I disengaged as it was brutal; brut force approach to driving.
1buvpqw,Speed was annoying though.
1buvpqw,Maybe its just me not yet knowing how to work it but it was poor.
1buvpqw,I set the offset to +5 over speed limit and that did not work.
1buvpqw,"If  the speed changed to 50 or less it set at +2, if the limit was over 50 the it set to +3."
1buvpqw,Checked settings and offset was +5.
1buvpqw,"If my Max Speed was set to 62 in a 55 I found the car slowed for most intersections, cars, curves, and who knows what and then I'm going 52, never going to make it home at that."
1buvpqw,I could not get FSDS to keep my set speed and was always having to manually accelerate.
1buvpqw,"TACC mostly holds speed and that is what I expected, not what I got."
1buvpqw,"When the speed limit drops from 65 to 55 FSDS resets the max speed from my setting of 72 to 58, but the car did not decelerate for a very long time, I would have to manually take over to slow it down for fear of getting a ticket."
1buvpqw,"So, it's to slow to get down to speed."
1buvpqw,"Many speed limits are not recognized by the car, so constantly making manual changes."
1buvpqw,"When I pass a 55 mph sign it sets Max Speed to 58, I then change it to 62, then a short while later another 55 mph sign and it resets to 58 again."
1buvpqw,Way to many manual interactions.
1buvpqw,"I tried changing settings all day, average, assertive, the normal driving setting in autopilot, the speed offset, but none changed the speed behavior."
1buvpqw,"Steering and navigation were good, speed too annoying to even bother with FSDS."
1buvpqw,"Will keep testing until my demo expires, and welcome any suggestions, but will not purchase yet."
1blf96v,New update drives below speed limit on autopilot FSD 12.3023.44.30.25 just installed.
1blf96v,Previous version would maintain your max speed unless there was a car in front or upcoming turn/stop.
1blf96v,Wide open road 55mph and MYLR is cruising at 51mph when max set to 64.
1blf96v,Is this the new normal?
raatcy,FSD 10.6 improvementsDefinite improvement over 10.5.
raatcy,Some notable updates in driving on my regular routes:  1.
raatcy,On a 4 lane highway where center divider becomes the left turn lane both directions: Unprotected left with oncoming car also making an unprotected left.
raatcy,Waited appropriately and correctly tracked the velocities of the oncoming cars as they disappeared behind behind the vehicles waiting to take their left turns.
raatcy,"I had a tough time personally keeping track of all the oncoming cars, but FSD did so correctly."
raatcy,This was a scenario where 10.4 and 10.5 would either wait too long or try to jump infront of oncoming traffic.
raatcy,2.
raatcy,Right hand turn onto the same highway where the “curb” is a painted white line with cross hatching to denote “no man’s land”.
raatcy,10.4 and 10.5 would be very indecisive about where to drive and would weave into the hatching.
raatcy,"Turn wasn’t very smooth, but it picked the correct line this time."
raatcy,3.
raatcy,"Reduced spouse/passenger nag triggers: Micro braking is still happening, but this version it is a slight/momentary lift off of the accelerator instead of a full lift/regen brake."
raatcy,4.
raatcy,Stopping at the stop signs actually stops in the right place.
raatcy,Even on assertive in residential areas it still waits too long to actually make the go determination when things are clear.
raatcy,5.
raatcy,Unmapped and recent road reconfigurations are a challenge for it.
raatcy,"It didn’t know how to do the controlled left across 3 lanes, despite some markings being present."
raatcy,"To be fair, it was unclear if it was a double left or not."
7vl8dh,"Tesla Pickup Truck Wish List, from someone that can't wait to take it off road."
7vl8dh,"Personal taste warning here, but I love trucks, and have some strong opinions on them."
7vl8dh,And a truck should also be ***USED*** like a truck.
7vl8dh,"As such, my (off the top of my head) wishlist:  1."
7vl8dh,Boxed frame.
7vl8dh,Ain't a truck without a boxed frame.
7vl8dh,'nuff said.
7vl8dh,2.
7vl8dh,Sensors/AP hardware needs to be removable/re-mountable.
7vl8dh,Either provide a steel bumper option or this is a must-have.
7vl8dh,3.
7vl8dh,AP needs to work with a lift (within reason obviously).
7vl8dh,Either that or don't be surprised if the truck never gets any real truck respect.
7vl8dh,4.
7vl8dh,NO FUCKING FALCON DOORS.
7vl8dh,Seriously.
7vl8dh,Kills the utility of the vehicle.
7vl8dh,5.
7vl8dh,"I tow a wakeboard boat, and they're not exactly light."
7vl8dh,BIG battery is going to be needed to maintain range.

7vl8dh,is a must.
7vl8dh,Same idea if I want to take it on an off-roading trip.
7vl8dh,6.
7vl8dh,AP needs to work with towing.
7vl8dh,Maybe sell a sensor/camera kit to mount on a trailer?
7vl8dh,7.
7vl8dh,Styling choice: boxy is better.
7vl8dh,"I get that the sleekness is great from an aerodynamic perspective, but rounded features look shitty on a truck."
7vl8dh,8.
7vl8dh,"Super ""nice-to-have"" feature: blank switches to run auxiliary lights or other add-ons off the 12v battery 9."
7vl8dh,"If you lift and get big tires, going to need to re-flash the computer to adjust the speedometer."
7vl8dh,"So either Tesla supports that natively (e.g. lift and tire sizes in a settings menu somewhere, or enable a service center to do it)."
7vl8dh,10.
7vl8dh,Ultra nice-to-have: I want to truck-pull the shittttt out of my buddy's Ram 2500.
7vl8dh,Assert dominance damnit.
c1glcc,Speculation: Tesla has discovered new battery breakthroughs and that is why there is a shortage in battery production.
c1glcc,They are focused on bringing the next generation production lines online for future products.
c1glcc,These new cells will be cheaper with a higher energy density and longer life.
c1glcc,"Instead of over investing in the current (2170) battery technology, I believe that Tesla is holding back in anticipation of bringing the next generation battery technology to market at scale."
c1glcc,"This would likely be installed in the Y, Truck, and Roadster and eventually S and X. While Model 3 and Powerwall/pack use the current generation cells."

5l684y,Seems like sometimes I get to my car and a window is partially down or the sunroof is  vented.
5l684y,"Could I be hitting something on the way out, or in the app (which doesn't do windows) or could my kid be messing with the fob(does it do windows?"
5l684y,)   Or can anyone assert that there are some bugs where the car does randomly open windows or sunroof?
5l684y,"If the sunroof or Windows are open and it starts raining, will the car notify or close them automatically?"
5l684y,Does rain get into the car if the sunroof is vented?

17uekud,Is this a wise decision?

1231uap,"FSD v11 is a major step backwards for highway drivingI've been on beta since the original ""100 safety score"" wave."
1231uap,"It's had it's ups and downs, but v11.3."
1231uap,3 is by far the worst version I've been on because of it's highway changes.
1231uap,Just returned from a ~300 mile drive and here are my ramblings.
1231uap,* No more following distance.
1231uap,"It's just ""Chill, Average, Assertive"" this controls following distance and lane changes."
1231uap,"I generally drive on a following distance of 2, but will increase distance if there is a slowdown ahead to avoid being rear-ended..."
1231uap,now I have to manually tick down speed.
1231uap,"* Auto lane changes are not a suggestion, the car is going to do them..."
1231uap,this includes attempting to change into a lane that ends in less than 100 feet.
1231uap,* Phantom braking.
1231uap,Jesus christ almighty I fucking hate this version.
1231uap,"It's not ""step on the pedal like we're gonna die"" it's ""let off the accelerator 10 times in a mile"" and it drove me so insane I disabled FSD/TACC for a while."
1231uap,It happened multiple times across the 300 mile drive.
1231uap,* Auto-exit passing lane doesn't happen unless someone is behind you.
1231uap,It'll happily stay in the passing lane all day if no one is behind you.
1231uap,* Merging on the interstate is just as dog shit as it's always been.
1231uap,"No turn signal, stay in the on-ramp lane until the absolute last second, the dive into the interstate."
1231uap,This version sucks and I hate it.
1231uap,/rant.
1231uap,"edit: Oh also it managed to pick up ""Minimum 45"" on the interstate and started slowing down to 45 in a 70."
1231uap,"I've driven about 40,000 miles in this car and never had the auto speed limit do that."

1cw2dgb,6 feels like a regression compared to v11Finally got the v12 update on my M3LR after being stuck on 2024.8.
1cw2dgb,x forever.
1cw2dgb,I immediately see what people mean by it driving more like a human: Acceleration is so much more natural compared to v11.
1cw2dgb,But this is the only improvement I see.
1cw2dgb,* My first intervention was 3 seconds into activating FSDS for the first time after getting out of the parking garage and onto the street.
1cw2dgb,It couldn't figure out how to navigate the stop sign whereas v11 had no such issues in this area.
1cw2dgb,* It missed wasn't taking [this](https://www.
1cw2dgb,"google.com/maps/@47.6311376,-122.1477858,18.59z?"
1cw2dgb,entry=ttu) exit.
1cw2dgb,It didn't even try signaling to switch to the right most lane while it was in the middle lane.
1cw2dgb,There was a car next to us but the standard behavior from v11 was to turn on the blinkers and wait for a spot to merge.
1cw2dgb,Nothing like that here for some reason.
1cw2dgb,* Drove over the curb [here] (https://www.
1cw2dgb,"google.com/maps/@47.6331277,-122.1432621,19.69z?"

1cw2dgb,"* Driving back home, it kept trying to merge into the right lane multiple times being too timid."
1cw2dgb,Turning on the blinkers only to turn them off attempting to merge shortly after again and again will annoy people that are following behind.
1cw2dgb,"Mode was set to average, not chill or assertive."
1cw2dgb,v11 was better in this aspect.
1cw2dgb,"Over all, v12 didn't live up to the hype in my car."
1cw2dgb,Perhaps it'll get better as I take it out more.
