1dr1vbu,lauks76,Minimum lane change.  I wish it didn't reset every time.
1dr1vbu,las9vxv,"I do chill, shut wipers off auto, set my distance between cars far, and only use it in clear areas (mostly freeways). Remember its SUPERVISED so be ready to take over at any time. Your judgement is almost better than the computer. I dont like the full stops and the slow creeps, so you can just hit the accelerator to override and have it keep going"
15s0wtg,jwbl9gr,Please say you called and asked about it!
15s0wtg,jwc0fa8,Adding the definition of prohibit is super condescending
15s0wtg,jwbqh71,Probably someone in the office was told to put it on every car and didn't question your car.
15s0wtg,jwc2us5,Put a sign on your dash next time that says El.ec.tric.car
15s0wtg,jwbvaex,BATTERY FUMES!!!!!
15s0wtg,jwc70ug,"Sadly, this is one of those ""if the person had enough brains to not do that, they'd have a better job than this one"" situations."
15s0wtg,jwc2b7m,"I can understand the point of the rule for ICE cars.  Since it sounds like they were OK with the OP charging with a 120V outlet, that information should get passed on to the people handing out the prohibit slips that EVs can back in."
15s0wtg,jwbvdtw,What a relief.  They should be so pro EV with the lack of emissions /s
15s0wtg,jwc403g,The fact they spell out prohibit and define it is condescending as fuck. Screw the person who thinks they can speak to anyone like that.
15s0wtg,jwbmfr2,"Shit like this makes me glad i dont live in an apartment.  Ill park however TF i want, thank you very much."
15s0wtg,jwbx2vl,I wasn't charging but backed in at the outside parking lot... there is a deck and sidewalk between the cars and the apartments.  I got one of these.  I doubt it would cause an issue other than with the worst coal rolling diesel truck or if you idled your car for a long time.   I mentioned the lack of a tail pipe and the answer I got was that they didn't have the... time?  expertise? ... to figure out if a car was an EV or not.
15s0wtg,jwcib82,Backing is also safer in the event of an evacuation alot easier to get out quickly
15s0wtg,jwbt8mo,"Call them, ask them if they stupid or what"
15s0wtg,jwbz9an,"If there was ever a hill to die on, this is it. Go at 'em."

15s0wtg,jwbufi9,This is why I bought a house. Fuck strata‚Äôs and HOA‚Äôs in their wrinkly dried out asses.
15s0wtg,jwchgeb,"Where I live, all parking houses have signs saying ‚Äú vorw√§rts parken‚Äù (park front first). It‚Äôs not even because of hvac, but just because they don‚Äôt want soot on the walls (Switzerland ftw). I have a bad habit of just parking reverse, just to make a statement üòâ"
15s0wtg,jwbugo1,They will tell you it's the rule and that if they let you do it people will see your car and back in too. Then if they get a warning they'll complain that the managers let you back in. Just get a good 12 Gauge extension cord and get on with your life.
15s0wtg,jwcn0i2,That was written by someone who can‚Äôt back in safely.
15s0wtg,jwd2l2e,They probably thought it was a honda civic.
15s0wtg,jwf1dki,‚ÄúMy car‚Äôs exhaust pipe is way across town.‚Äù
15s0wtg,jwbsr9j,*Please* raise hell about this and tell us what happens
15s0wtg,jwc47vu,That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a mistake to give a bullshit reason for things you don‚Äôt like. It‚Äôs always better to just be honest and say it‚Äôs because you don‚Äôt want cars backing in.
15s0wtg,jwc4tyh,Call that number and pretend you don‚Äôt know electric cars don‚Äôt have emissions and ask them to explain then ask how they expect you to plug in your car. Find out how stupid these people really are.
15s0wtg,jwcoj3n,You DID pull in ‚ÄúHEAD FIRST‚Äù.    Your feet are closer to the front of the car.  Your head is closer to the back.
15s0wtg,jwc187p,"Even on an ICE car this is pretty BS. Unless you're sitting there, idling your car for a long time + they have their window open + the parking space is right up against it, then the ""fumes"" will disperse way too fast for it to matter."
15s0wtg,jwbu3zd,Keep having them send notices to you. Don‚Äôt say anything. Make them contact you in person to chat and have them verbalize how your Tesla backing up causing exhaust issues.

15s0wtg,jwc6v8c,"Does this complex tow vehicles that have out of date registration?

Might be an excuse so that it's easy for them to see your tags."
15s0wtg,jwck0wi,I mean. Battery does release battery fumes and degass.
15s0wtg,jwcnkwn,You‚Äôre just blasting other tenants with electrons.
15s0wtg,jwcp733,"They prob want to create the norm. Monkey see monkey do. Can your cable extend if you park head in? If not, then you cant do anything else to appease the norm there. Maybe put EV in white stencil on the pavement lol"
15s0wtg,jwdjr52,"I suggest you pull your car in head first, but not because the idiots gave you some stupid demerit slip. I suggest you pull in head first so that the sentry mode side cameras can see the parking lot better. Remember, the B pillar cameras do not record sentry footage. I have seen way too many Tesla videos online where people would have caught some jackass on video had the car not been backed in. But that's just my two pennies."
15s0wtg,jwdah7s,"Do you need an extension chord to charge your Tesla I live in an apartment complex and I am looking to buy a Tesla. However, I live in TEXAS and I drive a 2010 Ford F-150 Platinum and I always park in reverse, never had an issue. I will need to charge my future Tesla in reverse too, but will more than likely need an extension chord lol"
15s0wtg,jwcac7k,"That's hilarious.

It's a shame they gave you the office number instead of theirs so you could talk some shit to them."
15s0wtg,jwcq5oo,Have you been farting and then opening the back windows? come on admit it...
15s0wtg,jwd0t7l,Well it probably has to do with emissions when the car farts ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
15s0wtg,jwdq29x,Nice
15s0wtg,jwdz2qf,Back in and start farting
15s0wtg,jwhnytw,"It may not make sense because you have an EV, but if everyone else with a more common gas vehicle saw you parked in reverse without getting in trouble then they would think it‚Äôs ok for them too.  If there are signs that say don‚Äôt reverse park, then suggest they have it replace it to officially make the exception for EVs or EV charging stall."
15s0wtg,jwc1et2,This is pretty typical. It's very likely that your rental/leasing office can't make exceptions for EV's because of Fair Housing laws.
15s0wtg,jwf3orf,I'm not a fan of people backing into parking spots in general. Usually the people who do it don't know how to drive so it takes them way longer than the time they're saving when leaving. Also it backs up everyone else trying to get through. But yeah this is a dumb rule by the building especially since your car is electric.

15s0wtg,jwfsst7,Funny!
15s0wtg,jwfts5l,The response would be great caught on camera‚Ä¶
15s0wtg,jwg7fc5,I‚Äôd back in infront of their window and loudly play an audio track of a revving ICE car.
15s0wtg,jwgp571,This is the most passive aggressive thing I‚Äôve ever seen!!
15s0wtg,jwhbtk2,"Not defending the note and this was 10+ years ago, but I got a ticket for backing into a parking space. Citation stated American Disability Act prohibiting reverse parking where enough space exists for a person to walk (assuming it‚Äôs to allow enough space for a wheelchair)."
15s0wtg,jwiqn4w,"No, they were told to put it on every car that backed in.

15s0wtg,jwgeaqw,Not sure what authority or law would prohibit parking in a spot in a certain direction

15s0wtg,jwcjgfe,"Typed like someone who has never needed to deal with tenants. These property managers are morons, but that part is not out of line IMO."
15s0wtg,jwdd7c4,And they break up the syllables in two different ways
15s0wtg,jwcea01,"Not going to lie, sometimes I get home and park at an angle across my entire driveway just cause it‚Äôs sort of fun."
15s0wtg,jwdsyx8,RIP to anyone with snooty HOA assholes though. Glad not to be in one. Not sure how those morons ended up with as much power over people‚Äôs personal lives as they have.
15s0wtg,jwcxg59,When I used to live in an apartment complex I used to park right in the middle of 2 spots so no one could park next to me. I do whatever TF I want when I want.
15s0wtg,jwdp0uw,If you ever watch a rocket launch from the bleachers at the CCAFS gate bleachers in Port Canaveral the MPs make you back in so everyone can get out in a hurry should an emergency happen.

15s0wtg,jwg33c1,Almost every mining job site or area where your doing blasting work makes you back in too for the same reason.
15s0wtg,jwcx4kn,So.... did you just blow in from stupid town?
15s0wtg,jwbvxc1,The are plenty of houses with HOA's too
15s0wtg,jwdo1zt,I think you meant shotgun.
15s0wtg,jwc5c25,"Yea I can see this being a problem if the parking space is like....6ft away from the window. If my ICEV is within 6ft of and the exhaust is facing my open garage, it starts smelling like fumes in there which can be uncomfortable. But then again, that's a big ass open door, not a little window."
15s0wtg,jwc9zre,I got one of these once because they said I would ruin the flowers.
15s0wtg,jwc3fbc,"That's how you find your car gone one day, with $350 to get it out of the impound because you ignored the signs saying do not back into the spots."
15s0wtg,jwgfcys,I love that word. Really gets the snowflakes melting!
15s0wtg,jwf89li,No extension cord needed when you back in as charge port on drivers rear. Typically recommended not to use an extension with charging unless a heavy gauge applicable cord is used which is rare.
15s0wtg,jwg1phx,"Um... no? I live in an apartment building, and as long as I park in my assigned spot, management couldn't give two shits how I park. Same in every other building I've been to. EV or not. OP's management asking people not to back in due to some piss-poor building design. And failing to realize it's an electric car that produces no emissions."

15s0wtg,jwdtfjx,Piss on their windows. Assert dominance
15s0wtg,jwhmhtr,"Private property rights.  If it's in the lease agreement, or has signs posted such as ""head-in parking only. Violators will be towed"" then they can have a tow truck come on by and yank your shit down to the impound yard.

&#x200B;

They probably can do the same if they can show that you've been warned in the past."
15s0wtg,jwgb784,Yeah‚Ä¶ Why go out of your way to define a word you‚Äôre not even using?
15s0wtg,jwg1eux,"Great point. They likely don‚Äôt have the power to actually prohibit backing in. If someone calls them out on this note they can say it‚Äôs just a definition, not an order."
15s0wtg,jwcwpga,So you get in trouble because it makes their job harder?
15s0wtg,jwe62ca,"Interesting that. At work, we have a policy that you *must* back into spaces. 
1. It's much safer when you leave and have restricted vision, no running over pedestrians. 
2. In case of an emergency and everyone needs to leave quickly, you're already facing outwards, so no extra congestion or issues for first having to back out of the space to then go forwards."

15s0wtg,jwg1z0z,"Your apartment management may not have a *park head in first policy*. For those that do, this is a very standard response."
15s0wtg,jwd5786,"**UPDATE**:

Alright guys, called the number and they got back to me.

The person who picked up sounded like Honey Boo Boos mother and was like ‚Äúwhat do you want?‚Äù

I told her: ‚Äúhey I got your message about parking backwards but I have an electric car, a Model 3, and it does not create any carbon monoxide, so you and your family are safe on my end‚Äù

She was like ‚Äú look sonny, I don‚Äôt give a hootenanny if you drive a model T or the Beverly Hills Hillbilly clunker, you park the right way and respect other people wanting to breathe clean air‚Äù

I tried reasoning with the lady for about 5-10 minutes but then she just got exasperated and said that her cat, Chairman Meow likes to be in the patio next to the parking and got carbon dioxide poisoning‚Äù

I told her ‚Äúlook lady, cars don‚Äôt create carbon dioxide they create carbon monoxide‚Äù and she was like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what I‚Äôm sayin! Park the fuck away from my apartment‚Äù

Exasperated I asked her ‚Äúlisten lady, what is it going to take for you to understand that electric vehicles don‚Äôt create emissions‚Äù

To which she responded ‚Äúabout tree fiddy‚Äù

I said ‚Äútree fiddy?‚Äù

To which she affirmed ‚Äúyes, tree fiddy‚Äù

It was at that moment I realized the lady talking to me on the phone was poking her head out of the apartment and was actually 500 feet tall and from the paleolithic era."

15s0wtg,jwc6yhe,Well obviously a rule created to alleviate exhaust in peoples‚Äô windows is a bit stupid in this case. Doubly so when you probably have to back up to reach the charger.
15s0wtg,jwe7uw2,"Rules are there for a reason.  If that reason does not apply, then the rule should not apply either.

About the only decent response would be to say what /u/minnick27 said, ""if someone sees this person back in, they think they can do it as well.""  To which I would reply: that's what the note is for.  Change the rule so that ICE cars cannot back in; then everything fits."

14xsvag,jrpcubg,I really need to do this. I‚Äôm at 100k but I‚Äôm in California. No snow. Did you search for Tesla specific? I‚Äôve done tons of brakes so this should be easy. It‚Äôs just lifting the model 3 that‚Äôs a pain since it‚Äôs low.
14xsvag,jrpwpg3,Cleaning and lubricating the brake components will help a lot and make your brakes function better. Definitely a must in salty winter climates.
14xsvag,jrorgxh,"Not sure why you're being downvoted, this is literally what you do. Take the wheel off, eyeball the pad, the calipers on modern cars are designed so you can see the pad wear without removing them."
14xsvag,jrq0cxg,Voids what warranty? Pads and rotors are always considered wearable parts on every car.
14xsvag,jrpvuac,"You are going to jinx me now!  So far only one windshield, knock on wood.  But I have gotten three flat tires, and so I carry a modern spare with me in the trunk at all times.

Generally speaking no major issues. My car was subject to the early temperature and pressure sensor recall for the HVAC. One of my high beams doesn‚Äôt point straight but I didn‚Äôt notice it until after my 50,000 mile warranty has expired and I‚Äôm not going to pay $1200 for a new light. I did have repeated service issues with the oil pump and oil pump wiring harness for my rear drive motor. But fingers crossed, I think it‚Äôs finally fixed.  These repairs were covered under warranty, but would have been an inexpensive fixes, regardless.

That said, given the significantly lower pricing today and the $7500 rebate, I am strongly considering replacing my existing car with either a new highland model three or the new model Y once the refresh is released in 2024 or so .

I specifically want the bigger 82 kWh battery , the softer comfort suspension , hardware 4, and perhaps ventilated seats.  

But the real issue I am concerned with, is the very small risk, say perhaps 5% of vehicles, of battery failure after the 120,000 mile warranty expires.

Fewer rattles, better sound proofing and air sealing, and better efficiency would be nice too.

Since I drive a lot, the drive train warranty will be expiring for me in about a year.   I cannot afford an unexpected $15,000 bill in the event the battery decides to take a dump.  I can breakeven and perhaps even turn a small profit selling this current vehicle paying off my loan and financing a new one.

I think it‚Äôs so funny. Folks are so concerned about the slow loss of battery capacity and range over time I could care less.  it‚Äôs the catastrophic unexpected failure of the battery or BMS post warranty. It keeps me awake at night. 

I really wish Tesla sold more extended warranties and covered more of the vital drivetrain systems under the drivetrain warranty. The fact that they don‚Äôt cover the charging inverters is ludicrous let alone the heat pump components needed to keep the drivetrain cool ."

Service is the least favorite part of owning a Tesla in my experience. I really wish they would create a strategic partnership with another auto maker or some thing and leverage the more traditional service center, model and existing physical locations."
14xsvag,jrrlrxf,">more traditional service center, model

14xsvag,jrsfk7f,My local Toyota and Subaru service centers are way more convenient and comfortable to wait in.  Now sales is a completely different story.  No doubt direct to consumer sales is the bomb.
yo3hka,ivc3i0g,"No this is normal, you have to accept the terms before going into the car. Besides if anything was wrong, and you wanted to reject, the process could be reversed. Plus if something was wrong and you didn‚Äôt want to reject, service would have fixed it for free."
yo3hka,ivctsl3,I asked to see inside of the car before signing and they had no problem doing that for me. I spent about 20 minutes looking it over and asking questions. I guess it varies by SC.
yo3hka,ivdl7nm,I bought mine used from Tesla and they refused to let me see inside until after I accepted delivery

1cmko8b,l31b8j0,I know exactly why FSD accelerates so quickly at a green light.   It‚Äôs embarrassed that it braked so hard to stop from going through the yellow.
1cmko8b,l325v5y,FSD is like riding with a skittish 16 year old driver. Amazing it kinda works but it‚Äôs not ready for prime time.
1cmko8b,l316cnp,"ITT no one is actually reading OPs post. 

My theory is that FSD is programmed to accelerate fast because it's trying to get out of the intersection as fast as possible for safety reasons. In case the camera misses a car."
1cmko8b,l323s2c,"@bumble_bea_tuna Just activated FSD on my used '21 MY Performance. For the first day, I thought it was kinda fun and hilarious how it rocketed away from a stop. But now I'd really like to be able to adjust it to be a little less aggressive. I also have it set to chill under acceleration and under FSD. Hopefully it gets addressed in the next software update or else my tires are gonna be toast üòÖ"
1cmko8b,l31mg7r,"Lmao, my friend was in a 400 hp sportscar following me and asked me why I kept flooring it, he had issues keeping up. It was FSD."
1cmko8b,l32352t,Disengage and send feedback. During the 1 month trial I did this after every stop light. ‚ÄúTraffic lights are not drag strips.‚Äù Is what I would say. üòÇ
1cmko8b,l32mq2k,Apparently not.  The FSD need a max acceleration slider.
1cmko8b,l32ltrj,"Agreed -- it would be nice if they dialed back the Chill mode in both AP and FSD to be more, well Chill. It seems to switch to Standard mode for acceleratation. Even braking, it seems, is horribly abrupt and both have very sudden throttle/brake changes without easing into them. It would be nice to have a way to tune the acceleration/braking in both AP and FSD."
1cmko8b,l31gf6q,"I had a similar experience with FSD during my 1 month trial. It braked harder and later than I would have (sometimes I felt it was applying the brakes, not just regen ), and it accelerated faster than necessary. Didn‚Äôt matter what mode (chill/notmal/aggressive) I selected.

ETA: I don‚Äôt use chill acceleration (pedal) mode in my LR. I can do the same thing it does by modulating pedal pressure. It doesn‚Äôt take long to learn a deft touch. And full power is available when I need it."
1cmko8b,l38i25z,"Elon has recently stated that future versions of FSD will be focused on ""comfort"". Accelerating/braking too hard should be worked out in the near future.

1cmko8b,l3bt4ok,MY SR RWD here. Both acceleration and FSD are set to Chill. The FSD accelerates my heart rates.
1cmko8b,l3170b6,"There isn‚Äôt. 
I had the same issue with FSD. 
Maybe use it only on the highways."
1cmko8b,l31hv1p,Which trim are you driving?
1cmko8b,l31f932,I had this problem but the v12.3.6 update fixed it for me.
1cmko8b,l32o1li,I hear about this on Reddit but I‚Äôve never experienced it. I guess I just got used to accelerating or something
1cmko8b,l3luc1x,No
1cmko8b,l311vix,[deleted]
1cmko8b,l32g1iv,Yup. It‚Äôs called self control of your right foot. Haha. Seriously I wish you could dial it down too but I don‚Äôt think you can. Fsd was even worse. I hated the way it started.
1cmko8b,l32z2d7,Did you die?¬†
1cmko8b,l326798,Yeah but a polestar
1cmko8b,l3193ie,Put it on Chill Mode is Pedals and Steering Menu.
1cmko8b,l313d31,"It's a pedal, not a button. Stop pushing it all of the way down if you don't want to go fast."
1cmko8b,l31docu,Facts
1cmko8b,l34paqc,"You can override this by using the accelerator pedal. Obviously it'd be best if it just worked, but when I see it trying to stop too suddenly for a yellow I could easily make, I just hit the pedal to keep going the same speed.

This also works for stopping farther up than right at the stop sign before creeping forward."
1cmko8b,l31hqbr,More embarrassing is FSD causing the person behind you to rear end. In Orlando yellow within 30 ft means GO!
1cmko8b,l32laou,Oh the pounding of nose on the windshield as it decides to slam your nose into the windshield because it decides to match the car in the lane next to you going 20 under what the rest of traffic is flowing at. Of course it's goal is to start braking at the back bumper and be matching by front bumper.
1cmko8b,l3291o9,üòÇüíØ
1cmko8b,l35u0dg,"I drive about 70 highway and 10 backwood miles a day and it honestly does pretty good on those.  I'm really impressed.  I haven't taken it into a big city yet, or heavy traffic."
1cmko8b,l32jvnd,That's false logic though. Most intersection accidents occur because someone running a red and the newly green car taking off. Safety wise your trained to wait a few seconds....
1cmko8b,l31axnb,"On an RWD model 3, FSD cornered so hard in the rain it earned 5 strikes in a week on its own."
1cmko8b,l31xblk,"getting past the intersection makes sense, but it continues the rapid acceleration even after the intersection."
1cmko8b,l31d67v,"Yeah, so many people are telling me to lay off the peddle when I'm not even touching it."
1cmko8b,l34e4pg,"I honestly feel like people are doing ""4d chess"" and not realizing there isn't a buffering/smoothing function built into AAC systems.

The car 'thinks' ""No reason not to floor it, don't mind if i do"""
1cmko8b,l35tccy,Yeah really!  My plan was to drive like a grandma to try to get as much life out of my ties as possible.  I drive 80+ miles/day so I know I'm gonna be buying tires within a year.
1cmko8b,l35sl58,"Ha, that's funny.  Do you have the performance?"
1cmko8b,l3396m9,I wonder how often these are looked at. They probably have some sort of algorithm for keyword searches on feedback messages. I hope they‚Äôre truly considering them for future updates
1cmko8b,l35sv97,"Yeah, I should.  Do you just verbally say it after disengaging?"
1cmko8b,l35uhie,Or let me set a number to the max G-force the operator wants to feel.  Something.
1cmko8b,l35tqz2,"Absolutely!  Like, these things are computers,.  Let me set my max G's I may not know what I want right now but after a couple weeks adjusting it we would figure out our comfort level."
1cmko8b,l35rzb5,FSD definitely brakes late and accelerates right away.  We need more control over that.
1cmko8b,l3d94n6,Awesome! Hopefully there's still some option for running it how we want too.
1cmko8b,l3d9gcl,"Yeah, FSD is like Forrest Gump trying to help Jenny.  It'll get there as fast as it can while still staying within the speed limit."
1cmko8b,l31dfmh,"Eh, that's not what I bought it for."
1cmko8b,l31lljc,Why does this matter
1cmko8b,l32hiys,"Not for me.  My passenger doesn‚Äôt like it so yells at me.  Damn‚Äôt Tesla, please fix this."
1cmko8b,l35umxi,Do you use FSD a lot?  That's what I'm talking about.  Not when I drive under my own control.
1cmko8b,l313cbp,It sounds like he's talking about FSD doing hard acceleration and breaking.
1cmko8b,l35u92b,"I'm talking about FSD, not my foot.  I don't have a problem with the way I drive."
1cmko8b,l35v7rq,Wtf man.  What am i even supposed to do with that.  Do you just feel like every thought that moves between your ears deserves to take other people's time up?
1cmko8b,l35u3jb,Ummm ....... okay.
1cmko8b,l31dln5,"There's a chill mode on pedles and steering, and on FSD."
1cmko8b,l318xs7,You don't push the pedal yourself when you use fsd
1cmko8b,l31crwa,You misunderstand my question. My foot isn't touching the pedal.  The car is driving itself.
1cmko8b,l31lk3y,And you own a Tesla but you don‚Äôt know this about FSD?
1cmko8b,l32uajv,"In California, ""it just turned red."""
1cmko8b,l32v4oz,"Not just false logic, it‚Äôs Tesla logic. Like the Cybertruck frunk"
1cmko8b,l370jlk,"Yes, MYP."
1cmko8b,l35tqj3,You should see a pop up in the lower left of your screen asking to press the right steering wheel button for voice feedback.
1cmko8b,l31dzvt,Only suggestion would be disengaging and reporting when it performs egregious accelerations so the FSD team gets informed.
1cmko8b,l32v8yo,Yeah but you also bought an unfinished product. So you take what they give you til it‚Äôs satisfactory. Literally what you paid for bro
1cmko8b,l31h5qg,Sucks
1cmko8b,l31p59j,Acceleration and trim are related. Let OP respond. I‚Äôm guessing he or she isn‚Äôt insecure about what they drive.
1cmko8b,l35rpl3,It's interesting because they let you set the speed max.  Acceleration max should be an obvious option as well.
1cmko8b,l31cj7g,Bingo.  It's not about me not being able to drive.
1cmko8b,l31lau1,Chill mode FSD Is just follow distance basically but you can do both
1cmko8b,l31cv98,True story
1cmko8b,l31si53,"I definitely don‚Äôt bother with FSD. I‚Äôm a pretty good driver that hasn‚Äôt been at fault for an accident in 20 years of driving. 

But with that said, I also wouldn‚Äôt relate to someone who feels like their car is too fast in the chill FSD mode."
1cmko8b,l34pkws,Cybertruck frunk already safer via OTA update. Now it won't squish a banana let alone a carrot.
1cmko8b,l3crhc2,That makes a little more sense then.  Yours is a pretty awesome sports car too.
1cmko8b,l36vvf4,"Oh okay, I was thinking that was some kind of voice control."
1cmko8b,l35r8sy,"Agreed.  I'm just asking IF there is a way.  Today is 1 week that I've owned the car.  I was assuming that if the option existed then someone more seasoned would know about it.

I make no assumption that this is the final form."
1cmko8b,l35sag1,"Ha, MYLR AWD.  How would that change it?  I assume it would have more get up and go with the AWD, but it's not the performance and I don't have boost."
1cmko8b,l36lg0g,"Yes, that would be very nice‚Ä¶..ü§ûthey fix it."
1cmko8b,l35sgdl,"Ah, thank you.  I've been playing around with them but I couldn't really figure out any correlation."
1cmko8b,l31t7u0,Same FSD Is slow for me lol I usually drive faster but It‚Äôs nice to have and I like watching to see how It evolves
1cmko8b,l36uulo,"Repeated failure, it keep increasing force until it closes. Unlikely circumstances where you loose consciousness with your hand in it you can say bye bye¬†"
1cmko8b,l35twbt,But really wouldn‚Äôt you confirm the option prior to purchasing? Unless you didn‚Äôt test drive of course
1cmko8b,l35slxn,"It doesn‚Äôt, I was just curious, it‚Äôs not like any of these trims are slow vs ICE. They are all quick."
1cmko8b,l31ybo9,"In my 1200 miles with the car, I‚Äôve had it emergency brake twice because it thought a car in the other was in my lane and I‚Äôve had it misidentify a flashing yellow light as a red light once while using cruise control/autopilot and try to stop. That has also happened 2 other times while I wasn‚Äôt using autopilot. 

So while I‚Äôm very happy with the car (‚Äò24 MYP), I‚Äôm far from impressed by its ability to identify what exists in the world and what it should do about it that."
1cmko8b,l377q6f,"what? you'd have to keep trying to close it, right?  it doesn't keep trying to close by itself"
1cmko8b,l35uzo4,Confirm the option of being able to set my desired acceleration?  No.  That is not something I have ever thought about confirming on anything in my life ever before I have bought anything.  But the next time I buy a house I sure will confirm 0 acceleration as my limit!
1cmko8b,l36vpat,The performance would definitely change it though
1cmko8b,l35vmn6,"When you buy a home you look at it, get it inspected and do all the due diligence you can before purchasing. I don‚Äôt understand that for your 2nd biggest investment, you wouldn‚Äôt do the same.

Did you buy on blind hype?"
1cmko8b,l35vqcy,I hope you know your comparison literally makes no sense and it also makes you look like a fool
1cmko8b,l36wzz8,"Your question makes no sense.  That was my point.  Of course I checked out the car.  Of course I inspected my car before I left the lot.  Of course I test drove one. 

You're saying that I should have known that there wasn't an option to limit the acceleration before buying the car?  That's ridiculous.  Literally nobody nobody in the history of human kind has ever ensured that their car had the option to limit the acceleration before they bought it."
1cmko8b,l37de01,You should have know the behavior of the car and asked preemptively about something you wanted. Now you purchased the car and are grasping at air hoping it has a feature to limit something you should have noticed test driving. But hey that‚Äôs the risk you took and now you live with.
1cmko8b,l3csgu4,"Are you for real?  All I did was ask a question and you're saying I should have known every single minute fact about the car before I bought it.  Facts to include features that have never been included in vehicles ever.

15anb0l,jtmi3rv,"In the recent Jeff Dahn (Tesla Battery Researcher) presentation, which The Limiting Factor summarized on Twitter, he says that to maximize NMC cell life you should charge for daily use within a narrow range like 40-60%.  Avoid charging over 75% frequently.  And store at a low SOC, especially in hot weather, then at like 30%.  Of course even if you don't follow these guidelines, the battery will likely still last longer than a typical ICE engine."
15anb0l,jtlzz4y,"One thing that might help range anxiety is to calculate the rough % you need to go to the farthest point in town you might realistically ever go without warning and back home (like somebody calls you to come get them or needs help) + 10% cushion.   Just to rough it, use 4 miles x your approx battery size.  I‚Äôd use 72 for a long range (math police: this is a rough calc assuming some battery degradation and regular driving).  Then just know that as long as you're above that level at any time, you‚Äôre fine. 

When I do this calc I get 30%.  So while I usually tend to charge the evening after I reach 50%, my rule is that I have to charge in the evening on a day where I reach 30 %."

I do live three miles from the nearest supercharger, which means I don‚Äôt need to worry about an unexpected need for extra range."
15anb0l,jtlv43b,"No, set the limit at 90%, plug it when home and go on with your day."

15anb0l,jtmouqf,"The replies are so all over the place; which is the gospel? It makes me think there isn‚Äôt one, except avoid 100% and definitely avoid 0%."
15anb0l,jtmxqzf,So there is a battery warranty. If you ¬´baby¬ª the battery chances are you might just miss a battery change under warranty. The only winner in that case is Tesla. Follow tesla guidelines and enjoy your cars with awesome range and care free ownership.  Part from rock chip and parked damage anxiety..
15anb0l,jtlzvfd,"ABC, but I gotta ask - did she fill her ICE car up every day she used it?"
15anb0l,jtm44cq,"Maybe you could compromise and leave it at 80-85% everyday.   I plug my car in every single day and leave home at 90%, 60k miles 2020‚Äô MYLR."
15anb0l,jtm5xlf,"Do you live near a supercharger , or any DC fast chargers? If so I wouldn't worry worst case you have to make a 15 min stop. Just keep it charged enough over 50%  to get to your destination plus to a supercharger if you need it. So like 80% Either way the battery will probably outlast the amount of time you want to keep the car."
15anb0l,jtlu2o6,"Did you need to fill up your tank every time you drove your ICE car? If no then you don‚Äôt have to top it up to 90% daily for Tesla. If you found out you need to go somewhere far and need a recharge on the road, that‚Äôs what the super charger network is for."
15anb0l,jtly88m,read your manual ffs
15anb0l,jtm7qvi,"If you have a home charger you should be filling it to what the Tesla tells you to do nightly. It will fluctuate on its own from 80-90%. It‚Äôs better for your overall battery health to fill it up from 70-90% daily as opposed to going from 20%-90% a few times a week.
So she‚Äôs right yes fill it to the trip value nightly, but listen to the car. Sometimes it will be 80 and others 90."
15anb0l,jtm935w,"I thought it was dependent on what type of battery you had. Maybe it‚Äôs different elsewhere. We are in Australia 

Lithium ion batteries in standard models - keep fully charged as much as possible
Cobalt-nickel batteries in performance models - charge to 80% only unless planning on a long distance trip"
15anb0l,jtmvann,I‚Äôd suggest learning about how the BMS works in Tesla cars. I saw an improvement with battery health by not charging up daily after learning about BMS.
15anb0l,jtn6pzj,"I'd say, if it helps calm your nerve, just do it. It is better to charge to 80% but the differences i have seen are marginal at best.   
It can be good for calibrating the pack to run it down once in a while, but that doesnt have to be every week or even every month.   
In addition to making your BMS happy, it can be helpful to know how low you can go, in case you ever need it. I drive my RWD down to 1-2 percent sometimes without even clencing one cheek because i know it can reliably do it. Even had a couple stops on longer trips where i arrived with 1% at a supercharger.  I know it is not great for the pack."
15anb0l,jtna11w,"(Copied from a previous comment on another post)

Based on your daily usage I would charge to 60%. That way you're hovering between 40-60%. 

I personally charge to 65% on work days as my commute consumes 10% one way, 5% sitting in parking garage for 13 hrs, and 10% back. I understand that my battery chemistry in particular likes to sit in the middle of the pack for long term use. For the most part it really doesn't make a difference which method of charging you use. 

At the end of the day the effects are negligible regardless of what some people say."
15anb0l,jtnkklv,"Best to watch the battery as a percentage on the dash and just not worry about it unless you‚Äôre under 10%. It takes a little time to get comfortable with it for. Some more than others. 

My wife was like this early on especially with a new born, but doesn‚Äôt even pay attention to it unless we‚Äôre on a road trip now. 

Charge between 80-90 each day. It won‚Äôt have a significant effect on battery life over time."
15anb0l,jtnyjbp,If only I could get my wife to fill her car every day so that when I need to go 30 miles I don't have to stop for gas.
15anb0l,jto02jn,80% everyday or schedule 95% for road trip departure time. Don‚Äôt overthink it.

15anb0l,jto1oyx,"Keep it above 20 as much as you can, and not above 80 unless your doing long road trips and need the extra range. This way you‚Äôll prolong the battery life. If you wanted to be the most optimal it would be keeping it between 30-60"
15anb0l,jto76n6,Did you do that with gas car?
15anb0l,jto82fn,I charge my car to 70% monday to thursday as I just don't need it and to 85% on the weekends on a SR+ which has less range than your model Y
15anb0l,jto99gr,"Give her time.  It took me a while to chill my range anxiety until I learned it‚Äôs not necessary, even on long road trips."
15anb0l,jto9we6,Does she fill up a gas tank every time it drops below 7/8's? Same idea.
15anb0l,jtod1ph,Users Manual provides instructions on battery management. Why not use those instructions?
15anb0l,jtoki9r,"If you‚Äôre daily mileage is low enough that you‚Äôre only using 10-15% of batt/day, you could charge to 90%+ daily and you‚Äôll probably be on your third or fourth car after this one before the battery degradation becomes even something to think about."
15anb0l,jtop6sc,I charge mine everyday but then use over 30% daily.  Try going on a road trip with the Tesla.  I did it 2x and hated it.  Talk about battery life dropping like a fly.  Real world range sucks when traveling although commuting is fine.
15anb0l,jtop8xb,"I do love this question, there's two variants of battery tech in the model y and the answer is exactly the same regardless... The answer is... read the manual.

The instructions from the manual will be different depending upon your specific battery tech of course, but since you didn't state which battery type you have, the answer is still the same. Read the manual."
15anb0l,jtopkka,"You should take her on a drive where you start at 100 and go to near zero (stay close to a supercharger). She‚Äôll be really surprised how far it goes, especially when you‚Äôre not on the highway. People camp in theirs overnight and only lose ~20% range (I‚Äôve done this in the summer in the South)."
15anb0l,jtouy1k,jamie and adam could have probably done an episode or 2 on this one.
15anb0l,jtowucw,"My town is fortunate to have a decent amount free level 2 charging so I am incentivized  to not charge daily for cost and convenience. 

during cold season I discharge to  as low as 20% and charge to 90%

during hot season I discharge to as low as 10% and charge to 80%"
15anb0l,jtoxcuj,Yeah charge her up to the recommended charging for daily trips. Mine is 80 and I top it to that every night or at least attempt to once it's parked in my garage. It's basically never not plugged in once I get home.
15anb0l,jtozspu,I'd think this applies to most rechargeable batteries but It's common with laptops. If you use a laptop while plugged in you can limit its total charge to 60% always having a battery at 100% degrades the battery faster and physically balloons stretching out the battery and lowering its total capacity
15anb0l,jtp4xjq,"As a compromise between the two users, I would set it to 85% and charge it up every day.

It doesn't really matter but maybe that will be good enough for both people to feel OK about it."
15anb0l,jtp73xs,"I just set my car to 70% because i don't even drive every day, maybe one to 3x a week until school starts. At that time, i will re-evaluate it. But for now, a trickle charge at 70% seems best for me."
15anb0l,jtp9ift,"Its an interesting situation for sure.  My biggest fear while owning my model 3 is to get a call from out of town telling me a loved one is in the hospital.  The last thing I want to think about is charging for 30 minutes before I hit the road!  


Most days though I wait until about 30-50 % to recharge.   


I will always try to have at least one gas car (or plug-in hybrid) for emergencies like I mention above."
15anb0l,jtpivuz,I charge mine to 80% every night.
15anb0l,jtplckz,It‚Äôs not the end of the world if you are charged less and you need it you can topoff at a supercharger..
15anb0l,jtpwbp9,"I charge to 85% every other day. It never really drops below 50%, so I go from 85% to 50% and back."
15anb0l,jtqxjtr,What she‚Äôs feeling is called ‚Äúrange anxiety‚Äù and it‚Äôs perfectly normal. It will also pass. Sit in the car and show her all the charging stations. Have you guys used a super charger yet? Do one just for fun. 90% daily is fine. Personally I do 80% but you gotta do whatever makes her feel comfortable. Even if it‚Äôs just in the short term. Good luck
15anb0l,jtt23mn,"In 26,000 miles in my MYLR. Stared at 330 miles at 100% now I get 300 at 100%. Lost 30 miles"
15anb0l,jtvv35k,"Ok their is soo much mystery about the battery / battery management/ variations with how the BMS works per software update (temperature variation) etc

Just use and abuse the vehicle to maximize your lifestyle happiness..  let her change as much as she likes..but 85 percent maybe good enough:)"
15anb0l,jtnsqme,Been charging to 70% since 2020 unless I need the range then I bump it to 90% before the trip. Only go to 100% for trips if chargers are too far apart.
15anb0l,jtmwcr8,That goes against everything I was told about my model 3 rwd lol. Literally everything I see says it's best kept at 100% whenever possible.
15anb0l,jtvviud,These are snapshot in time analysis‚Ä¶no one except Tesla understands the impact of the various software updates / BMS / temperature to provide concrete guidance‚Ä¶. Anyone who states they do..I call BS..
15anb0l,jtr754w,"Degradation is 1 of many factors a battery can fail, there are other things that can cause the battery to go bad too, it's pretty much lucky of the straw, there are battery packs failing within warranty period too"
15anb0l,jtphd8b,Over what period
15anb0l,jtvvrth,Yep..just enjoy and do not think about it..totally agree
15anb0l,jtnqz9x,"Yes, but how much?"
15anb0l,jtm2sfb,"Tesla documents say keep it plug it in daily, charge to 80%, and don't go below 20%. 

Personally I charge to 72%. I don't need much range daily.

OP do you live far away from a supercharger?"
15anb0l,jtmfsns,"> Tesla recommends to always leave it plugged in to 80-90%

I don‚Äôt see anywhere that Tesla says you should set it to 80-90%. It just says set to Daily range, which is between 50-90%.

https://www.tesla.com/en_CA/support/home-charging-installation/faq#percentage"
15anb0l,jtnvz30,My charging screen says 80% for day to day now. Is this a recent change?
15anb0l,jtmfngv,"> Tesla recommends that you top up the battery every day.

> Keeping it between 80-90% actually is the best thing to maintain it‚Äôs longevity.

I‚Äôve read that 50% is the best for the battery. The Tesla docs say to keep it plugged in each night to ‚Äútop off‚Äù, but it only says to set the limit to the Daily range (which is from 50-90%)."
15anb0l,jtmxdp5,"Keeping it between 30-50% is the best for battery longevity, however it's not that much better then keeping the battery around 80-90% so for practical reasons that it what Tesla suggests in the manual"
15anb0l,jtnvvhh,The screen literally says charge to 80% for daily use. Is that a recent update? I thought advice used to say 90%!?!?
15anb0l,jtm0oh1,"I like this advice, in particular the last point. 

First few weeks I charged back up to 80% each night, overnight. Then I realized how consistent my usage pattern was, I got really good as estimating how much battery I need in any given situation, so now I generally charge to 60% overnight or else adjust based on any extra trips I know I‚Äôll need beyond my 20% or so for daily commutes."
15anb0l,jtm1oko,She knows how to change it back to %
15anb0l,jtm17pe,Thats not what they‚Äôre asking.
15anb0l,jtm1w2c,"She used to fill it anytime it went below half. But I'd bet if we had a gas pump at home, she would have topped it up everyday!"
15anb0l,jtlz1fb,"If you have home charger then charge to recommended levels.

Any comparison to ice vehicle behaviors is comparing apples to oranges. Let go of ice thinking, do what the manual says."
15anb0l,jtm691k,Don‚Äôt be a douchebag
15anb0l,jtm1yvm,My thought exactly. High five!
15anb0l,jtn7kfz,Where does the car show this fluctuation?
15anb0l,jtof3on,"Obviously not. But then again, we don't have a gas pump at home... Otherwise she probably would."
15anb0l,jtoin2a,Do you plug in everyday even if you use around 10 to 20% daily? Or do u charge only when the soc drops to 30% or lower?
15anb0l,jtof5yg,"This is pretty much the same approach I take.  2023 MYLR and NMC battery.  I also did the same for my previous M3P 2019-2021.  Worked out great, except bikes and rack on the MYLR significantly skew downward, maybe 10-15%."
15anb0l,jtmx7h4,RWD has an LFP battery which is a different chemistry - charging yours to 100% is recommended for LFP batteries
15anb0l,jtnpxqg,"Best practices for LFP are similar to Nickel based chemistries. The difference is the BMS needs to recalibrate at least once per week by reaching 100% SOC. 

This is why Tesla says to charge to 100% at least once per week.

It is NOT because it‚Äôs the best practice for the health of an LFP battery itself."
15anb0l,jtngs7u,"It‚Äôs not ‚Äúkeep it at 100%‚Äù as that is still bad. It‚Äôs more that the BMS needs to charge the pack to 100% SoC periodically (at least once a week) to maintain a better prediction on usage. 

Long and short, LFP has a flat then sharp voltage curve, so it‚Äôs much more difficult to measure the SoC, lots more guess work based on measure what the car uses, versus the voltage of the pack."
15anb0l,jtmx9sq,You likely have a LFP battery (iron based) not NMC (nickel based)
15anb0l,jto0fit,"... because he was talking about the LR and P that have different batteries (NMC) than the RWD (LFP). If you have an LFP, charge to 100% each day."
15anb0l,jtnajwu,"Li-ion do not like 100% charge or under 30%, best storage is 60% charge"
15anb0l,jtnstf2,"Yes, only if you have LFP can you regularly charge to 100%."
15anb0l,jtnv592,"The one 100% charging recommendation on LFP is for the BMS to get an accurate reading of the battery, not for the health of the battery. The battery will still degrade faster if charged to 100% as opposed to 70%"
15anb0l,jto4afp,different type of battery than the awd
15anb0l,jtpf43g,I was also told this. I was told to keep the battery at 100% and keep the charger plugged in whenever the car is not being used ( if you‚Äôre lucky enough to have a home charging point). I think it also depends on the age of the car and obviously the batteries. Older batteries might have differing charging methods to keep their longevity.
15anb0l,jtqtedi,I guess simple math would be 2527 / 365 = 6.9 years if once a day. Twice a day would be like 3.5 years
15anb0l,jtm81em,"You should max it to what Tesla system says. 72% isn‚Äôt good for the battery health. It will automatically change from 80-90% on its own, so listen to the car, it will never tell you below 80, you need to increase your cell charge capacity to keep your battery health high."
15anb0l,jtnxhpd,"Seems like it? But I'm not sure.. my 5-month old MY is on 2023.20.9 and still says 90%. In any case, 80 or 90, the main idea to OP's question remains the same."
15anb0l,jton0bo,yes latest update has a different recommended based on battery chemistry.
15anb0l,jtn9m9e,"You are correct. As close to 50% is best from a battery chemistry standpoint.  However, Tesla‚Äôs official recommendation is higher because it‚Äôs factoring in things like convenience and potential emergency reserve.  Still though, 50% is undeniably healthiest."
15anb0l,jtnc3el,I didn‚Äôt know this! Even if this is the case we can‚Äôt always run our cars on 50% capacity. It would negate the convenience of always having it charged.
15anb0l,jtnvzxe,Just do whatever it says for your particular car/model year.
15anb0l,jtm1xu0,"But....why?  In any case, you can charge to 80% daily (or whatever the app tells you to)"
15anb0l,jtpninp,Put a black sticker over that part of the display :)
15anb0l,jtm1bnq,I am trying to help with the irrational fear
15anb0l,jtm6lm3,"This is a great point because for some people they would definitely do that. Also I think if the car went a legit 400+ miles on a tank and that percentage drop was a lot lower each trip it would be easier to swallow. 
I don‚Äôt have anxiety about it, but I drive 100 mi each day so it is very easy for me to get low if I don‚Äôt top it off each day. In fact last weekend we didn‚Äôt get to use the Tesla on a longer trip (200mi) because I forgot to plug in. We don‚Äôt have many super chargers and we didn‚Äôt have time to make a pit stop. 
Let her top it off however she wants. It likely won‚Äôt hurt the battery in any noticeable way. Whatever lowers the overall anxiety level in the house is probably best."
15anb0l,jto8d38,how is that being a douchebag. it literally tells you how much to charge your car depending on the battery type.
15anb0l,jtqk37c,Plugged in at all times in the garage. Set charge to 70% as mentioned normally.
15anb0l,jtp6h5x,"Plug in whenever you can, as per owner‚Äôs manual."
15anb0l,jtpinkv,SOC?
15anb0l,jtqk2rj,Plugged in at all times in the garage. Set charge to 70% as mentioned normally.
15anb0l,jtmxa9m,"Gotcha, I see a lot of weird info about batteries on teslas. Glad mine is so easy."
15anb0l,ju79bll,What does the model y long range 2023 have?
15anb0l,jtoi2nt,"Why does everyone always have such different opinions on this? I see anywhere from 40% to 90% for my model 3 rwd with the new battery. Vs what actual Tesla said to me at service and on the car itself saying to charge to 100% every opportunity I get.

I just don't get how you guys are somehow significantly more insightful than the carw own recommended care and people who work on them? Not bashing just seems so strange lol. And the inconsistency on the number. ""Keep at 60%"" ""keep at 90%"" and now I'm seeing ""keep at 70%"" lmao"
15anb0l,jtpjm12,"Exactly I was told for the health of the battery not just the ability to determine the range that it's best to just keep it plugged in when your not using it. 

But apparently keeping it at 80 and charging it to 100 once a week seems like what the reddit lords are saying lol. 

I don't see them saying it's a good idea to keep at 100 and get give it a 8 year warranty and replace it under said warranty if the degradation is worse than a normal threshold they expect.

Just seems weird lol."
15anb0l,jtr9rno,https://youtube.com/shorts/fiqvH4ZN2hU?feature=share
15anb0l,jtmjssz,"I‚Äôve had a model3 since early 2018. I always charge it to 60 sometimes 70% unless if I need to travel I‚Äôll do more. My battery has not seen any deterioration it‚Äôs rock solid. Straubel was quoted around the time I bought it saying it‚Äôs best to keep the battery always between 30 to 70%. So recharge when you go to 30%, charge it close to 70. Worked great for me with this specific battery design.  I know they are changing so it might not apply to newer models"
15anb0l,jtmsbx5,I‚Äôm sorry you are wrong
15anb0l,jtnqt8v,How do you come to that conclusion on the 50%?
15anb0l,jto5q3r,"oh definitely don‚Äôt worry about charging to 90% daily, that within Tesla‚Äôs recommendation.

I‚Äôm just saying that 90% is not better than 50% for the health of the battery. So if you only consume 10% daily, it‚Äôs fine to set it charge limit lower."
15anb0l,jtm262r,That's what she prefers. She's not into distances.
15anb0l,jtpsl8h,State of charge
15anb0l,ju8gnvp,"You don't have an LFP battery so you should most likely set your daily charge limit to 80%. Apparently the ideal percentage level to charge to is 50% but the difference between keeping it always at 50% to 80% isn't worth worrying about. You could even get away with 90% as that used to be the recommendation from Tesla. 

One thing to avoid is keeping it at 100% for too long or letting it stay less then a few percent."
15anb0l,jtoxij8,"Because it depends on what your goal is, if it‚Äôs accurate measurement of the battery percentage then charging it to 100% is your best bet. If you are more concerned with degradation than 70% is the sweet spot since that is the point before the voltage peaks.

This article explains it better:

https://www.autoevolution.com/news/the-puzzling-reason-why-tesla-misleadingly-recommends-charging-the-lfp-batteries-to-100-187075.html"
15anb0l,jtq29ya,"As far as I understand keeping it plugged in all the time is to take the load off the 12V (now 16V) low voltage battery to help extend it's life, and has little to do with the health of the main high voltage battery.   Letting it sit at 100% is not ideal even for LFP cells.  The difference is probably, that LFP cells are the ""million mile battery"" and even when abused, will likely outlast the rest of the car, so Tesla isn't too worried.

I've never charged my LR (NMC) to 100%.  Daily I charge to 65%.  Will charge to 90% for road trips and occasionally 95%.   I don't think I'd treat a LFP much different, other than occasionally charging to 100% like Tesla says, which I believe is for the BMS, but I wouldn't do it every week unless I actually needed that range.  Once a month is probably enough.

Basically, no battery likes extremes.  (Temperature, SOC, fast charge/discharge)"
15anb0l,jtml66f,"The most recent models with the new batteries are charge to 100% daily. The MY for the most part are 80-90 and that is also a daily recommended charge. For the longer term battery health of MY except for the most recent battery is to recharge it to 80-90% daily and won‚Äôt kill your battery to recharge at 20%, but it will have more loss over time. But how much is the real question."
15anb0l,jto8ek3,By being assertive
15anb0l,jto8k2k,"That's just the property of Li Ion battery.  For example, if you go to FPV drone community, where owners need to do the own battery management, they would charge their drone's battery to 50% for the winter seasons."
15anb0l,jtoex9z,I‚Äôll have to play it by ear to see what level works for me. I‚Äôll probably most likely keep it topped up to 90% anyways though.
15anb0l,jtm2x8q,Has she gone on a trip where you actually use the battery so she knows how far it will go with 80%
15anb0l,jtp9npv,"I see I see, that really sucks. So what, charge to like 70% weekly and once a week pump it to 100%?"
15anb0l,jto8u5h,That is a non-answer.
15anb0l,jto8yvd,those are very different batteries. That's non-applicable here without evidence.
15anb0l,jtm3qm8,Yes. But that hasn't helped. Her reasoning is that we might need to drive far suddenly  in an emergency or something.
15anb0l,jtpjk1b,"What I do is charge to 80% twice a week, them every couple months I charge it to 100% and I have no issues. The reason I do 80% is because I go to the office twice a week and if I charge to 80% while there I‚Äôm good and rarely have to charge at home.

If I always charged at home every night I would probably do 70% or so since that‚Äôs plenty for me to make it through an entire day. 

I only charge to 100% when making a long trip which is about once everyone month, and I have no issues. The biggest thing that kills Lithium based batteries is sitting for periods if time at high voltage. For example you don‚Äôt want to charge to 100% every day when you only use 10% on a typical day. You especially don‚Äôt want to go to 100% then leave the car sit for a week while you‚Äôre on vacation."

15anb0l,jtq4oc0,"Yes, I have the M3 RWD wife has MY LR we basically charge them both the same way."
15anb0l,jtm750t,"There's no need or benefit in draining it from 80% down to say 10%

***Always Be Charging***  is another recommendation. 
This is independent of whether you limit it to 80% or 50%, just that whenever possible plug it in.

Tesla used to recommend daily charging limit be kept not more than 90%, but now they have changed it to 80%"
15anb0l,jtm68x5,"No, actually it prefers not.  Low state of charge hurt the battery."
15anb0l,jtm7865,"Correct

Battery is happiest in 20% - 50% range"
1bs1pta,kxcu7hg,"Just select ""Autosteer"" in that first option. You'd be disabling FSD though until you can park the car and turn it back on."
1bs1pta,kxdliut,What‚Äôs the difference between the two options?
1bs1pta,kxfrsvv,"Hey Op,

You could also leave it on FSD but then just click double pull. The single pull will activate auto steer so you can have both and use the visuals of the FSD program."
1bs1pta,kxcuwek,"That‚Äôs what I assumed is the case. If I am understanding this correctly‚Ä¶ FSD beta 12 now only allows you to select FSD or Autosteer but wont allow you to switch between FSD or Autosteer while driving like before?

This is a massive regression and a royal PITA. I tend to switch between FSD and Autosteer on road trips for good reason and now no longer have the ability to do so."
1bs1pta,kxicoen,"FSD is an autonomous driving mode where the car will stop at intersections for lights and stop signs and change lanes on its own.

Auto steer merely is adaptive cruise control and auto steering to keep the car in a lane up to a set speed. Very different behaviors. Previously when I subscribed for FSD I would switch between the two modes regularly depending on the environment."
1bs1pta,kxgqo28,This is incorrect. Since the new version dropped you no longer can select that option. It‚Äôs blacked out. Hence OPs question.
1bs1pta,kxd4vnq,"Tested today. You can change fsd to autosteer mid drive. I got yelled at 3 times for literally nothing. Driving at night, fsd on, holding wheel, looking at the road and it just yells at me and disengages. After the 3rd time I said screw it, i rather have autosteer. I was able to change it while driving."
1bs1pta,kxcw7at,"Ya I think that is the case unfortunately. I think it‚Äôs so people don‚Äôt confuse between autosteer and FSD being on while driving. For example, would be dangerous to think FSD is on but only autosteer is on at an intersection."
1bs1pta,kxd3bvq,Just put minimal lane change on FSD and it's basically autosteer. That's easy to toggle on/off.
1bs1pta,kxguuxl,Sorry didn‚Äôt know that. Sorry for the misinformation
1bs1pta,kxicerk,How did you manage to do this? Could you provide steps you followed? Are you sure you are on FSD beta version 12? Are you on Tesla software version 2024.3.6?
1bs1pta,kxicavh,Disagree. The algorithm on how tightly it approaches your set speed and how it behaves and hesitates really differs and heavily impacts the way I drive.
1bs1pta,kxh0qmc,No worries. Just was pointing that out as it just happened for most people in last day or so and that one caught me off guard. Another poster said maybe the govt didn‚Äôt want people getting confused and regulated it but that seems odd as it was an option before. It‚Äôs not like anything changed with the new FSD. It‚Äôs just much improved but it‚Äôs still driver assists and not entirely autonomous. But yeah they changed that feature for some reason.
1bs1pta,kxmlhv0,"While driving or parked go to settings > autopilot > change from fsd to auto steer. 

I was on 2024.3.6. Now on 3.10."
1bs1pta,kyij0xh,While driving this option is disabled. I am only able to make this change while parked. Is this consistent with your experience?
171ubsx,k3tdh59,"I recently got a MYLR and have 3 months of FSD and am on this version. I don‚Äôt plan on buying FSD, but have been trying it out and frankly, it is absolutely terrifying. I keep feeling like something must be wrong with my car because it is SO terrible. I‚Äôve tried various drives around Denver on surface streets and highways and I have to disengage constantly. I really do hope it is something with my car, because it‚Äôs hard to believe Tesla is charging $12,000 for the stressful and scary experiences I‚Äôve had in my attempts to use FSD. I didn‚Äôt buy the car for FSD, and thankfully everything else is great."
171ubsx,k3t9g7n,"I‚Äôve had this version for about 2 weeks. No significant FSD changes, but there‚Äôs a bunch of minor UI changes."
171ubsx,k3unini,"I got the update just yesterday. It‚Äôs mainly to bring FSD to one of the never software branches with GUI and feature updates. 
I‚Äôm using FSD every day to bring me to work, to the soccer fields, and every other location I need to go. It works fairly well. The main issue right now for me is that it wants to take wrong turn lanes. But I already know which ones it‚Äôs prone to take. So other than that it works fairly well and it‚Äôs fun to use."
171ubsx,k3v345x,"I have a 2023 MYP, I live in the DMV Area (Virginia). I can say FSD works great for me. It can confidently take me on my home sub urban streets, unto the highway, and into DC without disengaging. However in the city I turn it off because it is still a bit scary with the way other drivers cut you off, it‚Äôs very unpredictable."
171ubsx,k3wgvep,"Recently purchased my MY with trial FSD. Not impressed at all. One second your eyes look down u get ding, 3rd ding u r out and punished for the rest of your trip. Cant believe people pay 12k for this!"
171ubsx,k3uukpv,"It is all the same, FSD will have weird or slow reactions somewhere. Already gave up this crap"
171ubsx,k3wi7jn,"I continue to justify the 212 bucks a month as I am a part of making it better.  No way in hell would I pay the full amount during purchase.  So glad I did not!  It for sure is scary on the city driving, it is horrible at timing others moves at intersections.  I allow it a go but quickly realize it can‚Äôt beat the human skill.  Certainly fun to show off, until it decides to go straight in the middle of a uturn jumping a sidewalk or two.  Being fast to intervene is paramount in this beta testing.  Night time is a no go,  I am now at 2/5 disables for no reason whatsoever, both at night."
171ubsx,k3wolvj,This update also has more boop-boop noises when shifting. Preparing Model 3/Y owners for a stalkless future.
171ubsx,k3w8c67,"Works well... 85% of the time in Rural NC... which is still nice when you're tired or on a long drive!

This particular update actually is pretty great for all the other features."
171ubsx,k3t21za,"I just got the update as well. Unfortunately I don't think I'll ever use it. Until such a time as Tesla is covering crashes, seems a lot of risk for no reward. I don't mind driving my expensive toy myself."
171ubsx,k3wthnx,"I have a 23 MYP that I‚Äôve had for 2 weeks
Mine just updated to 2023.32.7
FSD beta v11.4.4
How far behind am I from the latest update"
171ubsx,k3ww3vm,"I have 2019 MX and just got this update a few days ago. It broke my Navigation, side mirrors on screen no longer work, GTW errors galore. I‚Äôve had the car for 4 years and this is the 1st time I‚Äôm truly annoyed with it."
171ubsx,k3x3rh0,So much for telling everyone next update would be milestone v12ü§∑ I've given up waiting.
171ubsx,k3xkggq,Are you a bot?
171ubsx,k3xlsgu,Did you have Fullself driving before this update? It‚Äôs been drivable on city streets for a long time now.
171ubsx,k3uydkf,Nope. This is FSD.
171ubsx,k3x3dp7,FSD or FSD Beta? They are very different!
171ubsx,k3xasa9,"This is why I haven't used it yet even though I'm like 6 weeks into my free 3 months. There's a decent amount of traffic where I am, and I just don't trust it to not get me into an accident"
171ubsx,k3vrf5u,"FSD is truly a modern marvel, but I don't have any intentions of trying it until it is *really* good.  It's just not my jam. Regular AP helps me so much as it is.  Shout out to all the early beta drivers out there.  I'd need a lot of xanax to do what they did."
171ubsx,k3vy3m8,This
171ubsx,k3x26dj,On the highway is the only time I feel it does on par with a human driver.  Local streets I am thinking to up my life insurance every time I engage FSD
171ubsx,k3xr5mq,FSD for my 23‚Äô MYLR with HW4 cameras has actually been pretty amazing. It drove me from my house to Orlando Florida and I only had to take over 3 times over a 9 hour drive other than pulling into super chargers.
171ubsx,k3xvicm,"Just purchased a MYLR as well. Haven't used the FSD but the experience with the phantom braking while using AP has been very unpleasant. My wife won't even use AP anymore due to fear of accident. She was on a completely empty road approaching a green light intersection. 45mph speed limit. Car brought itself to a complete stop in the center of the intersection while the light was still green. 
I absolutely love the car. But I would honestly prefer stupid cruise control as an option at this point."
171ubsx,k3yok2g,Idk what version they give free trial but mine works great on 23 MYP. I can set it in my garage and it will drive me to the gym 8 miles away and I only need to push the accelerator in one area. Idky but between these two lights it wants to slow down for some reason. Other than that it‚Äôs amazing. I wonder if it by area. Like they have more data in wine area versus another.
171ubsx,k3vef8j,"It‚Äôs hard for me to think that someone can have such a different experience than I do unless either there‚Äôs a problem with my vehicle, or possibly very different human trust/tolerance levels for letting FSD do its thing even when it‚Äôs crazy. Just today my car merged wildly close to a car in the right lane and cut it off in a very dangerous way for no reason. I‚Äôm going to give FSD some trials for the 3 months I have it, but until I can take a nap on my way home, or at least not be twice as stressed as just doing the driving myself, I can‚Äôt even consider purchasing it. I really do hope that it‚Äôs better for other people and they are getting some use out of it!"
171ubsx,k3x6p3m,How does it do on 66? Does it randomly think the speed limit drops to 40/30?
171ubsx,k3xkm14,I need the noises.  In a stressful situation of having to back up quickly I want to hear that it shifted to reverse
171ubsx,k3xujh8,You got me genius
171ubsx,k3xumn7,Yes its been a month and its horrible on city roads.
171ubsx,k3v1la7,"Wowza, it‚Äôs eye opening seeing for myself how far away we really are from autonomous driving! FSD is somewhat OK on basic highway driving, but residential and surface streets for me have been mind bogglingly bad. It feels like if there was a police officer nearby I would almost for sure be pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence. It also feels like FSD increases my chance of being rear ended by a lot."
171ubsx,k3xjy5k,FSD is beta for everyone
171ubsx,k3y2238,"I've been using it a fair bit and here's my 2 cents: without navigation, using it is a slightly superior autopilot/autosteer imo. With a navigated route, it's decent on highway and large roadways of 4 lanes or more with traffic. I don't trust it on 2 lane roads unless there's no traffic. But you have to babysit it on turns, highway interchanges, and when the road adds lanes. I will miss it a little bit when my free trial is up, but in no world is it worth $12k"
171ubsx,k3whdgb,I tried it for a month. It‚Äôs more workload and stress than teaching an unlicensed teenager how to drive. I‚Äôm reasonably confident that the price point for FSD was cooked up after an engineer told Elon how far it needed to go to be useful and Elon said something like ‚ÄòI could charge $15k for a non transferrable option and people would still buy it!‚Äô  The engineer probably agreed breathing a sigh of relief that this would radically reduce the number of FSD in use and by extension the company‚Äôs liability.
171ubsx,k3xkn8p,"I don‚Äôt know if this will help but it‚Äôs a thought, you could try to recalibrate your cameras, it could help. Also there‚Äôs some specific settings on FSD that you can tinker with to make it more safe or aggressive. I also make sure that when I enable FSD it doesn‚Äôt throw me right on speed limit. I‚Äôve noticed that if you have it to match the speed limit on the road your call will accelerate to match it and potentially freak out it when it realizes it might hit a car ahead or miss a exit because it‚Äôs trying to catch up to your parameters. I set a - speed offset of about 3-5% ( I think, about 3-5mph) and I make sure to atleast be near the speed limit.  I drive with the most aggressive lane mode , and let it do its thing."
171ubsx,k3xwc2m,That‚Äôs what a bot would say.   And post something useless.
171ubsx,k3xv8mt,I don‚Äôt know that it makes any difference but do you have Hardware 4 or 3?
171ubsx,k3xk9ea,I know but you still have to request it and get an update that has it included. I was wondering if that had been done.
171ubsx,k3xl1px,"I also accidentally got kicked off FSD last week, and noticed that the Tier under FSD (Lane assist package) absolutely is horrible and phantom breaks 24/7. Im starting to believe Tesla only gets at full capacity when you drive with the FSD as it allows the cameras to see everything, like on FSD you can make it full screen and see things bird‚Äôs eye view vs the tier below where it‚Äôs just standard lane assist and will only show you what‚Äôs near your car. Just things I‚Äôve noticed‚Ä¶"
171ubsx,k3xlblq,"I may try that, thanks. My experience seems to be just general bad decision making by the car not related to distances the cameras would be calibrated too, but it‚Äôs worth a shot."
171ubsx,k3xwitq,And yet you are here on a useless post. Mind going on some useful post?
171ubsx,k3xvdlq,I purchased it last month. Seems like HW4
171ubsx,k3xko5n,"Yeah I think we are all talking about FSD Beta, not enhanced autopilot. FSD was grayed out for me when I first got the car and then became available with this software update last week. I understand that for 2023 Y‚Äôs with HWv4 FSD hasn‚Äôt been available at all until the last few weeks."
171ubsx,k3xvxii,Ok probably so. I have hardware which 3 which has had FSD beta for a long time now. I feel like mine is almost scary good. Not perfect by any stretch but can do some routes without any takeover. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs that I have seen where it came from either. Not that long ago it was extremely bad so I can say it‚Äôs going in a really good direction considering the improvements they have already made.
171ubsx,k3xlcau,"Interesting. I still see a lot of people on Twitter saying they are unable to get beta. 

I have hardware 3 in mine and throughout the last year it‚Äôs insane how good it has gotten"
171ubsx,k3xlpic,"I‚Äôm going to try and find someone I know with HW3 and FSD to do a compare where we do the same drive in each car and compare. I have wondered if my experience is just FSD in general, or specific to the ‚ÄúVision‚Äù only model."
171ubsx,k3xm2e8,Hmm now you have me wondering as well. I would love to hear feedback if you have that option. I don‚Äôt know anybody with HW4 currently.

17bjt07,k5jre34,I hope this fixes the major regressions introduced in 11.4.7.2 especially the jumpy and murderous lane change behaviors
17bjt07,k5k2zwx,"Can they finally make the ""minimal lane change"" button actually do what it's supposed to?"
17bjt07,k5litu8,"lets hope they fix the un-necessary running of the windshield wipers.

That and stop with the need to go into right turn lanes when going straight."
17bjt07,k5k9av1,I‚Äôm still waiting for the day it doesn‚Äôt drive 35 mph into the two roundabouts in my neighborhood and then stop completely INSIDE of the roundabout to see if there are oncoming cars.
17bjt07,k5kwft6,Looks like same release notes as the two prior versions.
17bjt07,k5naagb,Boy we need this. 11.4.7.2 is the flakiest version I‚Äôve had in the past 2 Years. I have been turning FSD off more often than I ever have before.
17bjt07,k5n695k,I hope they figure out how to slow down for dips in the road. I don‚Äôt really want to dukes of hazard the dip by my house going 45.
17bjt07,k5k0xha,"I think this 11.4.7.3, and 11.4.7.2 are v12 in shadow mode to do validations before they push it, like they did with Tesla Vision back in 2021."
17bjt07,k5l98mt,I cancelled my subscription because the amount of times it changed lanes into the wrong lane when I needed to turn in .2 miles was so frustrating.
17bjt07,k5n3mf8,"I thought 11.4.7.2 would fix the Autowiper functionality that died in 11.4.7.  I‚Äôm in 11.4.7.2, autowipers still do not work right."
17bjt07,k5jrnl1,Oh ok improved dead lane change.. that‚Äôs what I need‚Ä¶. Keeps turning into dead lane here in Toronto
17bjt07,k5ky7so,üêåüêåüêåüêå
17bjt07,k5l8thp,2023.27.7.  So does Tesla version numbers go down?  Cause im already on 2023.32.9.  Though  FSD Beta only on v11.4.4 :-(
17bjt07,k5zuhd8,Is it just me or is there 0 delta in the description for 11.4.7.2 vs 11.4.7.3??
17bjt07,k5kdr3m,"Gosh, I wonder why they are spending capital to write more refined code for v11, if V12 is imminent and obliterates the need for code completely?"
17bjt07,k5y0z0x,"Please just let ME control lane changes like on the highway! The lane changes, even on highway for the exit, are done way too late during ‚Äúauto lane change‚Äù. Funny how I got downvoted each time I mentioned this way back when and now it‚Äôs even more ridiculous. 

Still slows down on blinking yellow emergency lights and school zone traffic lights that are off. 

I can‚Äôt stand the ‚Äúchanging out of right most lane‚Äù. 

Still doesn‚Äôt have good vision during curves with a traffic light at the end. With cars waiting at the light, it takes too long to notice them.

I still control the car during right/left turns at busy intersections. It‚Äôs just still not good or comfortable for me. 

In a couple random occasions the ‚Äúslow down for emergency vehicles‚Äù were false. 

LOVE the keeping speed of flow of traffic but yet it still dropped to the slower speed limit instantly instead of gradually. I also wish this feature worked a little better in that if every car is passing me it should notice that it‚Äôs going a bit too slow. Option to toggle this on/off.

Still nerve racking on single lane roads and neighborhood streets. It‚Äôs just waaayyy too close to the center lane line for me, especially during curves‚Ä¶"
17bjt07,k5o4r42,"Why oh why don't they make Minimize lane changes (or whatever the Autopilot setting is called) a persistant setting?  I get frustrated (as many do) with the seemingly random and unnecessary lane changing, but never remember to revert the setting to minimize before starting out on a trip.  What's Tesla's rationale for keeping that setting for current drive only?"
17bjt07,k5q415z,"I have had a little phantom breaking come back, but nothing crazy. I don't think the cameras see traffic stopping ahead enough vs human and I tend to dial down the speed ahead of time.

I would love the ability to force brights on. I don't understand how this is still a thing without having to hold the turn signal knob."
17bjt07,k5rcfoa,Will this fix the drop speed to 55 mph when exiting the interstate only to speed up going on the ramp?
17bjt07,k5u423o,Is it a wish pond or something? Expecting tesla to fix all problems at once?
17bjt07,k5ud97p,"More generally speaking, the challenge FSD has had in the last couple years (in our opinion) is that it continues to:

‚Äîhave an apparent inability to use data far enough down the road. A driver can clearly see: 

traffic congestion in 1 or several lanes a mile or two down the road, 

or an accident, 

Or near an intersection or stoplight

Or busy lanes even more proximate to us

And it will then proceed to lane change right into the slow lane, then decide shortly afterwards the lane is to slow for the given cruise control speed and change back out. 

It‚Äôs frustrating at how bad it is at looking down the road, for clear problems, for a system that is supposedly mimicking ‚Äúcameras on a gimbal‚Äù as Musk likes to say. 

 ‚Äîupside: it‚Äôs not nearly as bad at gunning it to the next intersection, stop sign, or right turn lane, and then hard braking 2 seconds before the car in front of you, or stop sign, that it finally sees. 

*But it still has way too many situations where it hard brakes that could clearly be avoided."
17bjt07,k5yjqzp,This new version sucks. I used it for 4 miles of residential and suburban roads with almost zero traffic (Sunday morning). I had 5 interventions. Extremely wide turn without an obstacle. Hard acceleration into a speed bump. Incorrectly read speed limit (35 in a 25). Veering into the curb after passing through an intersection. Driving in the middle of an unmarked residential street (no cars parked).
17bjt07,k60pva6,I had an interesting thing happen with enhanced. Autopilot. On freeway and voice says take next exit but the blue line was going straight. The car followed the line. Strange.
17bjt07,k68q9ei,This update made the FSD so much worse. Never had so many problems!
17bjt07,k5k0ysl,[deleted]
17bjt07,k5jx408,Yeah does it still suddenly lane change into the turning lane a breakneck speed when going straight? Because that shit is terrifying.
17bjt07,k5ktjix,"Since the last update or two, mine has refused to change into or out of the HOV lanes when I signal, even if I'm the only car on the freeway. It used to be fine with that. Would be nice to see it change lanes properly again."
17bjt07,k5pi0xq,"I had a scary incident with 11.7.4.2 last week. 

Sunny, dry roads, warm'ish fall day, moderate traffic on a highway. FSD set to 'average'. Not driving into the sun. Doing about 50 mph, good distance between me and the car ahead. 

Traffic in my lane suddenly slows and then stops. Straight road, not on a curve. I usually trust AP/FSD to brake as needed, so I let it. My car slows a bit, but realize not nearly enough. I take over, slam the brakes to the point where anti-lock kicks in, and stop 2-3 feet away from the car ahead. Wtf - avg human driver would have been much better than fsd. Never had it perform so badly in the years I've been using AP/FSD.

I wonder if dropping radar support had anything to do with it."
17bjt07,k5kahv4,Does Musk still like to merge into the lane further left of Joseph Stalin when you are 1 mile from your exit?
17bjt07,k5l8u6k,"It freaked me out the other day when the car went into a cloverleaf interstate exit at 75 mph and slammed on the brakes to a point where my tires squealed. 

I will now no longer allow FSD to exit the interstate for the remaining FSD subscription time."
17bjt07,k68cq8e,"I‚Äôm finding it likes to do weird lane straddling now with this update, not a fan of this behavior"
17bjt07,k5k8e1k,It only disables changing into the faster lane for traffic.  Unfortunately wrong lane changes to ‚Äúfollow route‚Äù and swerving into right/left-turn only lanes (which it doesn‚Äôt see as a lane change) are the problem.
17bjt07,k5kp7mw,"It does, the issue you (and the rest of us) are having is because the system thinks it \*HAS\* to change lanes to follow your route. The issue is the incorrect map data (or the system's inability to ignore it when it seems unnecessary).  


It's essentially driving like someone who is expecting one thing, but ends up seeing another. The expectations are coming from bad map data."
17bjt07,k5kme0i,This sounds like more work than just doing a regular lane change.
17bjt07,k5mkyr9,I‚Äôd take just for it to be toggled permanently again. I hate that it‚Äôs ‚Äúfor this ride‚Äù now
17bjt07,k5yf1fm,It does what it seems to say for me. What behavior do you think is wrong?
17bjt07,k5opb13,My wipers either run as fast as possible to the breaking point or never run. It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating for real
17bjt07,k5uffhq,"‚ÄúWell maybe if you cleaned your windshield of insects every once in a while, we wouldn‚Äôt have this problem!‚Äù Haha. I‚Äôm just kidding. You‚Äôre correct, wipers are very difficult for them."
17bjt07,k6k1u1f,"I'm glad it's not just me.

Everyone always complains about the auto-wipers, but for my wife and I they have worked just wonderfully ever since we got our Model Y at the start of 2021. 

It hadn't rained in a while so I don't know what software update broke them, but they're unusable now. They engage when there's no rain (just wet roads), and DON'T engage as my windshield fills up with water. The speeds are all over the place and almost always not what is called for.

We've gone from ""this is the best set-and-forget feature"" to ""I turned it off and control speeds manually like a caveman."""
17bjt07,k5uphhj,"I haven‚Äôt experienced getting into the right turn when going straight yet. Lines in my town are pretty good. I did experience my first wtf are you doing moment on 11.4.4 last night though. Tried to pull out in front of traffic going 55-60mph. I was already at the creep limit with my nose almost poking into the road, car coming, displaying the car in blue on screen, oncoming car is maybe 50ft out going 60ish and Tesla says fuck that, let‚Äôs go! Threw me back in the seat for a split second and I hit the brakes. Oncoming car swerved and honked. Made me look like I wasn‚Äôt paying attention and if a cop saw I‚Äôm sure I would have gotten pulled over just to see if I was intoxicated. It‚Äôs never tried to do something so reckless before. Besides that, 11.4.4 has been great lol."
17bjt07,k5kd567,"When it came to a complete dead stop *before* a residential roundabout with no other traffic coming in any direction ... it was annoying.  But given there was a car right behind me that was totally *not* expecting the idiot in front of him (i.e.: me, my Tesla) to come to a complete and full stop and had to brake hard ... that's when I realized that FSD was just not reliable enough to use frequently (glad I'm on a monthly subscription).

I can believe that it won't ever put the *nose* of the car into another object.  I think it will do ok with that.  But potentially causing an accident otherwise?  Yeah, too many concerns still."
17bjt07,k5kyzp3,"I'm still waiting for the day it doesn't slam the brake because it sees big stop signs thinking it's near, and drives on the right side of the wide roads and does not creep for 4-way stop intersections, and slow down for road bumps"
17bjt07,k5kfce8,Just move to Austin or San Francisco. Works great.
17bjt07,k5u44es,How weird. I am on 11.4.4 and it takes all my round about s without stopping. It goes through them just fine
17bjt07,k5lx111,Just continued bug fixes and adjustments. Probably won't see anything new until late November or December at the earliest.
17bjt07,k5q3e0v,Sometimes it‚Äôs the best I have ever seen ..and then some days I‚Äôm like wtf
17bjt07,k5opo2p,"Agree, I barely let it control anymore, always have to take control unless it‚Äôs a straight line on highway, of course it tries to keep on lane changing for no reason."
17bjt07,k5k7rcf,I've been noticing way more data uploads in [11.4.7.2](https://11.4.7.2) then in other builds. I'm thinking they are trying to get more training data for v12 now that they've changed the camera color correction to match closer to HW4 cameras.
17bjt07,k5lcgrs,I think they're doing the same for 11.4.2 on HW4. My car has uploaded close to 90GB in the past month.
17bjt07,k5kcm0p,"Wishful thinking IMO.

If these versions still give a text readout on what it is doing and why (even if the action makes no sense) that probably isn't a v12 prototype.   The thing with true neural networks - is we don't really know *why* it's doing what it's doing.  So I kind of expect those explanations would disappear in v12 for a while ... maybe forever.

Hey, I would 100% love to be wrong and this is a secret stealth ""all neural networks"" build, but I just don't buy it."
17bjt07,k5oke2o,Same. Waiting for a better version to drop. When I first subscribed (4-5 months ago) it was much better than the most recent version.
17bjt07,k5ufqp7,Has a very hard time looking down the road far enough. It‚Äôs like a little 8 year old trying to pay attention to everything close to it.
17bjt07,k5js5gz,"The release notes are identical to all other 11.4.X updates, so we don't know what actually changed in this update. We only get new release notes for new major versions (for example, 11.5).

And where in these release notes do you even see ""improved dead lane change""?"
17bjt07,k5juj12,"This is by far the most frustrating and dangerous thing FSD does right now. It will swerve me into a turn only lane for ""efficiency"" on a 2 lane road and immediately freak out when there's no more lane and it's really bad."
17bjt07,k5lnee6,11.4.7.x  is on a old branch of the main software. People on the bleeding edge of new FSD versions have always been serval main versions behind on the other things. You won't see FSD 11.4.7.3 likely. It's for employees right now and will possibly go to testers who have had FSD for years.
17bjt07,k5lwf4h,"No, you are on an entirely different branch where beta is built into the main software that everyone gets and doesn't require an additional download. You likely just joined beta in the last few months or have a HW4 vehicle. Those that are currently on 11.4.7.2 (2023.27.6) are legacy beta testers and there is no way for you to switch."
17bjt07,k5oq0m3,We are the people that got the license that never worked‚Ä¶ and now of course my 2021 MS raven is called Legacy as well!
17bjt07,k5kxsbw,"Tesla has never said it's imminent.

They said words to the effect that it's very promising and in early testing.

Many people are using v11 and improving it helps those people"
17bjt07,k5rwv2d,I bet they merge the v11FSD stack with base AP and EAP before moving to v12.
17bjt07,k5ogg2m,Probably so you'll eventually let it do its thing by forgetting to click that button.
17bjt07,k5ueor2,"You‚Äôre absolutely correct. 

This is similar to a comment above that we had where even after a couple years it‚Äôs bad at looking down the road very far in many situations. It just doesn‚Äôt use this data well. So it likes to:

‚Äîgun it ‚Äîhard brake ‚Äîgun it etc."

In too many situations still."
17bjt07,k5t7m3o,"Sometimes I feel I have to apologize to other drivers for my Tesla‚Äôs rude behavior when it changes lanes. Letting cars merge has gotten better, now it slows down and let‚Äôs other cars in."
17bjt07,k5kpby6,This is exactly what I'm talking about. On a route I've been doing for many years through all iterations of AP/EAP/FSDb
17bjt07,k5mcnfk,"Even not in a HOV lanes, I‚Äôve noticed a strangely delayed response to manual lane change requests. In the past it would always change (assuming it was clear) within 2-3 seconds. Now the car will sit there with the blinker on for up to 10 seconds or more. It‚Äôs very odd."
17bjt07,k5n3uju,"Mine seems to allow changing lanes into an HOV lane, but FSD beta will not change lanes out of the HOV lane to make a right side exit."
17bjt07,k5mz88u,[deleted]
17bjt07,k5lcy1d,I have the same issues. It just stays there.
17bjt07,k5qz10y,"Absolutely. TACC has gone really backwards since they removed radar. It‚Äôs been working its way up to parity, especially with FSD beta, so I think what you‚Äôre experiencing was just the .2 regressions and I‚Äôm hoping this .3 release fixes it. I think they‚Äôre not really focusing on V11 anymore while it‚Äôs full steam ahead on V12"
17bjt07,k5lhd7f,"I tend to have the opposite problem - there's a major interchange with permanent traffic about a mile before my exit. Wide open road afterward. Only way to do it efficiently and with least risk is to hug left until you're past.

Since you can't turn off auto lane change, I now turn off the navigation as I approach to keep it from diving into the slow, dangerous, cross-merging traffic to the right.

Not sure whether the answer is to provide some commute-specific memory, per-lane traffic info, or what. But knowledge from driving it every day certainly seems like a human advantage in this case."
17bjt07,k5onew8,"This is amazing to hear. I have a few clover exits I take somewhat frequently‚Ä¶ it will go a few feet into the exit / clover pattern at a very high speed, but then decelerate quickly but fairly smoothly. It is ‚Äúscary‚Äù how fast it would go into those clover exits, but I‚Äôve never seen it not adjust properly. There are likely many variables between the clover you exited on and the ones I did.

Sic months ago it went into a simple exit with a significant curve, fast, and it was determined to ignore the curve and go straight ahead onto the grass. I let him go pretty close before I disengaged. It does that same turn beautifully every time now.

While I have _definitely_ had some m bad experiences with FSD Beta, I drive a lot ‚Äîand I still gotta say, the utility it provides is overwhelming, I ‚Äòcouldn‚Äôt live without it‚Äô anymore (it would clearly be a ‚Äòfirst world problem,‚Äô that is) ‚Äîthat genie is out of the bottle."
17bjt07,k5tekyj,"My impression of FSD is ""99% of the time I'm not having a near-death experience"""
17bjt07,k5mbj7m,"The stupid lane changes related to ‚Äúfollow route‚Äù are one of the worst things about FSD currently. On a very common trip I take, in a specific spot, the car will change into the wrong lane for about 5 seconds and then switch back to right lane, even without any cars nearby."
17bjt07,k5lkz7r,"Makes a ton of sense, and it's my #1 issue with FSD. A lot of the roads I take are 2 lane for a while, then go down to 1. Thing is I'm in the left lane, turning right in a few hundred meters but I know the right lane ends, and the car doesn't. Which is understandable when you're out of town or something but it's on your own street and you drive it 10x every day you expect the car to learn. Hopefully this update helps"
17bjt07,k5qcsr0,Yep. This is the only fix I want at the moment: working wipers again.
17bjt07,k5k938g,"The color matching stuff doesn't make sense to me.

It's known that what we see in the cameras is NOT what the car sees, and navigates based off of.

If it mattered, they would color adjust the forward facing camera as well.

Wish I could logs on how much data I was sending to Tesla..."
17bjt07,k5kcu9n,"Yeah, I don't even think the FSD computer is working off an ""image"" per se. It's always been said, it uses the raw data steams from the cameras.

I remember seeing a post on Twitter ages ago discussing the old repeater camera light bleed issue and it possibly interfering with FSD. Some hacker pulled the raw data stream from a repeater cam and the light bleed was much less noticeable compared to the image you're shown on the display in the car.

EDIT: Found the post: [https://twitter.com/rice\_fry/status/1503184608166248448](https://twitter.com/rice_fry/status/1503184608166248448)

tl;dr - the original raw 10-bit stream has enough data for FSD but the tonemapping+compression for the UI/dashcam  makes it look way worse"
17bjt07,k5lej2v,I suspect they're starting to collect multi trip reconstruction map data more
17bjt07,k5ky52b,"You seem to be unfamiliar with what Shadow Mode releases are.

I'm going to refer you to [this talk](https://youtu.be/g6bOwQdCJrc?t=962) with Andrej Karpathy.

He talks about how they did Shadow Mode releases to train Tesla Vision.

Basically people got like 2021.4.12.2, then got rapid fire updates with release notes of ""Cold weather improvements"".  It looked like [this](https://imgur.com/VFOtj2b) from a firmware perspective.

The cars were not running Tesla Vision as the primary OS, but rather Tesla was running Tesla Vision in the background, and was validating whether or not the system was behaving like the human driver in circumstances.  People driving the cars are no idea what was going on, just that they'd been segmented from the rest of the population, and they were getting these rapid fire updates.

What we're seeing with FSD Beta 11.4.7.2 and now 11.4.7.3 *might* be FSD Beta v12 running in the background setting information back to Tesla in terms of whether or not v12 is performing as expected in comparison to what 11.4.7 does right now.

This would also make sense on why folks running FSD Beta 11.4.7.x have been segmented from the rest of the population still, is because we're being used to validate v12 in the background, while running 11.4.7.x

So, yes, we'd still see readouts of what it is doing, and why, because *we* are using 11.4.7.x, but on the back end the car is ALSO running v12 and comparing notes on whether or not v12 is making correct decisions on its own.

so, I'm not implying that we're secretly running v12, but rather than v12 might be running in the background.

There's precedent for Tesla doing this."
17bjt07,k5jx5xq,Damn it.
17bjt07,k5mj4ds,"YES‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve seen that as well, I‚Äôve given up and just cancel FSD when I want to change lanes now. I‚Äôve never seen a regression so annoying in the 4 years I‚Äôve had my Model 3. Today it was weirdly hugging the right side of the lane on one freeway I take home regularly, and then fine on the second freeway. I hope the update fixes some of the quirks recently."
17bjt07,k5t7ulq,Turn off HOV preference in navigation settings. Now if you need HOV use turn signal.

18wcumo,kfx80ba,I'm curious if the end to end FSD in V12 means that all the C++ they wrote for V11 was ultimately a waste? Or did they need to use V11 as a stepping stone to get the V12?

18wcumo,kfxj68o,"cannot stand the left lane camping it does.

Here's one scenario that really surprised me: You're driving in the fast lane (left) of a two-lane highway because slower cars stay in the right lane. Then a faster car approaches from behind.

V11 has done this for months

""FSD v12 is more patient and assertive during lane-changing maneuvers. There's no more ""middle-of-the-change hesitation"" (changing mind in the middle of a lane change).""

Has this reviewer even used a recent V11 that's another thing that was fixed for like 6 months since the initial migration to vision processing

Something is truly wrong with this review, the fact he says ""stopping at stop signs for 5 full seconds isn't necessary"" is the current V11 way that stop signs are dealt with, so far all early notes of V12 have been that the car doesn't even come to a full stop at most stop signs and has persistently been a super slow rolling stop."
18wcumo,kg1ondc,do you think there are still major issues with the version that are holding it back so long to the public?
18wcumo,kg0m6es,A lot of things you mentioned were fixed in the last update (not 12). My car moves to the right lane and handles speed limits reasonably already.
18wcumo,kfycs5r,"Sorry but placebo effect here - this release does -not- use v12 for highway, highway stack is still v11.   V12 end to end net is for city streets."
18wcumo,kg14t7q,The problem with stop signs isn't necessarily the fact that it stops fully. The problem I have is that it stops fully too slow and doesn't resume quick enough. This is amplified when another car is in front of me and forces the car to stop prior to getting to the stop sign.

This is the opposite behavior of what it *should* be doing. It should stay in the right lane until it encounters a slower car, pass on the left, and move back over. V10 and earlier handled it properly, V11 broke it, and it seems V12 is carrying on."

18wcumo,kfxlijd,What I wonder tho is how will V12 handle edge cases such as avoiding accidents (which could always happen in a different way). Will it still be NN or will they use C++ for these cases?

18wcumo,kzcba3a,"Previous FSD always had trouble in a specific roundabout that had two lanes going straight.

Not in the very first v12, but in one of the more recent ones, this is finally solved! It is now smoothly navigating the roundabout.
after encountering this problem everyday for nearly 2+ years, I am super pleased with this development.

BTW, what exactly is new with the latest 2024.3.15? Lately, the SW updates are just repeating themselves -- am I to assume that these updates are just ML updates with a freshly retrained AI model?"

Sure, I understand that they couldn't legally program it to do anything but a full stop (though there should be a way to enter a secret code that would unlock varying degrees of California rolls that would use the cameras to detect the presence of police officers to force an occasional full-stop), but the way it is now, the Tesla will commonly let TWO cars go before it takes its turn.  Very frustrating, even for the second vehicle, as they often pause, not knowing what's going on."
18wcumo,kq5drk4,The pulling over for a faster vehicle and switching back behavior existed in v11.. it even messages switching lanes for passing smth like that
18wcumo,kq5ounm,"Driving in the fast lane - that v12 behavior is dangerous. Unless you're driving lower than the speed limit on the fast lane, you should NOT be changing lanes to let someone pass you. #1 rule in driving - leaving your lane is the most dangerous thing: any idiot can continually drive in their lane forever.

The correct behavior for driving in the fast lane - go the speed limit (you can drive in the fast lane without passing if you're going the speed limit). If someone is gaining on you - they are speeding and breaking traffic laws, force them to make the increased risk of changing lanes and not you."

18wcumo,kfy6gpv,Stop sign handling was soooooo much better before the fun police (NHTSA) got involved. Now I specifically avoid a specific road on the way home just to avoid FSD making full stop at every single stop sign -.-.

18wcumo,kfx7pmw,"Yes, very sad. fuck the NHTSA. No one drives like that. It actually makes things LESS safe, because it is so unnatural, unnecessary, and unexpected. It confuses and irritates other drivers. Very bad decision from those chodes at the NHTSA. they just hate Elon tbh."
18wcumo,kfx7ubo,I always described it to my wife (also a developer) when the car did something stupid as as ‚Äúthis is where you can feel the thousands of IF‚Ä¶THEN‚Ä¶ELSE statements bumping into each other and stepping all over each other.‚Äù

You don't want the NN to get trained by just any idiot with a Tesla or we'll soon be doing donuts on FSD :P"
18wcumo,kfyeka3,"Training (not to be confused with calibration), requires enormous amounts of computing resources (see DOJO investment) so it would not be feasible to train with in-car hardware!

18wcumo,kfy2bvw,r/restofthefuckingowl
18wcumo,kfxdcg1,Similar situation in many parts of Seattle. Very interested in seeing V12 up here.
18wcumo,kfxc6nr,"I think yes and no. 

On one hand, Tesla was clearly hoping that they would only need AI for object recognition, and only realized later that they needed full AI for all functions. 

On the other hand, the C++ code was a solid foundation. If they were able to use the code to train the AI on the basics of driving, then train the AI using the video footage, it probably reduced training time significantly. 

After all, if you have an AI that knows absolutely nothing, then it will spend a significant amount of training time wondering ""How the Hell do I keep myself centered in the road?!"""
18wcumo,kfxe7y8,"No, b/c previous versions have a vision NN and the controls in C++. They are still keeping the original vision NN and just replacing the C++ part. The code they replaced is also not a ‚Äúwaste‚Äù because it allows them to improve the vision NN + roll something out to customers + learn things."
18wcumo,kfxrwz9,"Reaching critical mass of drivers using FSD and thereby generating the necessary training data was essential to AI success. Also, we literally didn't have the AI technology to do it 5 years ago. Things have moved \_fast\_."
18wcumo,kfxlmrx,"It's a stepping stone. They gained more experience in the technology as time went on and technology and processing power improved. 

 Keeping it around feeds into the sunk cost fallacy."
18wcumo,kfxfimz,"As a developer, code is never a complete waste. At least if it's written by remotely decent devs. 

Something like twitter is a completely different story tho as it was so beyond bloated for so many years."
18wcumo,kfxet22,"Most of FSD isn't the C++ code it's the perception neural nets. Those are still exactly the same just feeding the new neural net drive planner.

Also the amount of training videos needed for this is astronomical and the compute cluster size would have probably been impossible before.

Tesla is stretching the term ""End to End"" in this example to mean just that there are neural nets the whole way. But all of the evidence points toward it not being end-to-end trained but still a hydra network as before with reused outputs for efficiency and development manageability."
18wcumo,kfx8xie,"The optics sure look that way, but this whole endeavor is evolutionary and it‚Äôs possible there were some valuable lessons building the neural network in v11 that made building v12 easier.

18wcumo,kfzmris,End to End means using the neutral net for the input and the output. The AI now controls the car directly instead of manually written code with rules on how to drive.
18wcumo,kfxlukk,Yes. The Tesla team confirmed they have been working on it.
18wcumo,kg7aav3,"Safely rolling through after confirming it was safe to do so and not blowing through. In most of the western world, those would be primarily roundabouts or yield intersections, and they have lower death rates."
18wcumo,kfxrpln,"It's trained on drivers who camp in the left lane, eh? Hopefully they clean up the data so that FSD uses the passing lane for passing and gets back in the right lane when finished."
18wcumo,kfxo2j3,"Right? This is idiot driver behavior that creates the slowdowns and perpetuating it into the future just negates one of the main benefits that full self driving should be working towards - safer, more efficient roads.

The passing lane is for active passing. Not passing anything right now? Get the f___ out of the passing lane."
18wcumo,kfxl3qu,‚ÄúDeparting right lane‚Äù it proclaims
18wcumo,kfxzn6e,"It also really annoys me that when it's in the left most lane it still stays centered in the lane even with a full size shoulder to the left. Real people always favor the left side in that lane, especially in California where lane splitting is legal."
18wcumo,kfxqis9,"So slow the car down, like seriously how do you people not realize the way you get out of the left lane is you dont' set your max speed higher than the flow of traffic, if the middle lanes are doing 65 and you set your car to 70 it's going to go into the only lane it can get closest to 70 which is the left, it won't keep dodging in and out constantly its going to stay where it can maintain your target speed."

18wcumo,kfx7osi,"> It should stay in the right lane until it encounters a slower car, pass on the left, and move back

True.  But depending on traffic, it‚Äôs not too unusual to encounter a large cluster of slower cars you need to pass.  

If you‚Äôre in the process of passing a group of 10, 15, or 20 slightly slower cars, and a car comes up behind you wanting to go faster, you should temporarily slow down, merge right, and let them by.  
Then resume passing the group of slow cars."

18wcumo,kfymbt9,"They can use the training simulator to train it on scenarios they design. The major difference in the NN and C++ is rather than writing in behavior statements of code in C++, they have to give the NN training data with a scored evaluation of desired outcome for it to train against and find optimal solutions. Through this method, they can provide it scenarios they custom design to address specific behaviors, and then also adjust the scoring criteria to help guide it's development. There is a term in NN development called 'Breadcrumbing' where you use scoring criteria that is different than the desired end result, but something intermediate that you use to get it heading in the right direction, then change the scoring criteria once it is closer to keep it moving in the direction of the end result. I suspect they are using a lot of Breadcrumbing in their current approach."

18wcumo,kg1t3h9,"This is really the goal of most Autonomous systems though isnt it? To be slightly above average than the humans who would do it normally?

Of course ‚Äúabove average‚Äù depends on A LOT of factors, and could change by the field/task the autonomy is being implemented, ie the primary ‚Äúabove average‚Äù function for a machine drawing a star on a cookie for a confectionary company is likely speed over precision, but for manufacturing space craft parts its probably precision over speed.

As we continue to see full self driving and other autonomous driving become mainstream, we will start as a society to determine what factors of driving we need the system to prioritize and be ‚Äúabove average‚Äù on to be allowed to drive without human input. I am excited to see what those factors end up being. Or if it will be a sort of Turing Test instead where a human has to monitor it for some time and determine if it drives at the same level as a human or is worse. Leaving the decision to Human perception. 

Sorry for the rant lmao"
18wcumo,kfxlp0b,Musk said V12 is when FSD will come out of BETA. He didn‚Äôt say that would happen on day one. He never even hinted at that. It seems obvious that v12 would need to be tested in the real world for a while before coming out of BETA. Why would you assume it would on day one?
18wcumo,kfyiozi,There‚Äôs no way it could ever do a roundabout correctly. In the U.S they‚Äôre better off keeping the road layout that it was designed for.

18wcumo,kpdvnyy,"You despise rolling stops?  I don't believe I've ever heard a human say that.  Are you sure you're not an FSD computer?  Or perhaps you work for the NHTSA?  Ha!  Even cops love rolling stops, because then they can issue tickets.  
I realize I'm doing it... and if you ribbed me about it as my passenger, I'd simply suggest you get used to it.  Having to bring a vehicle back up to speed from a complete stop is the least efficient way to drive.  I'm surprised an allegedly ""green"" state like CA doesn't actually encourage it under the right circumstances... like when no pedestrians/children/cross traffic is present."
18wcumo,kgyq83o,If a stop sign is recognized the vehicle will come to a complete stop unless overridden by the driver. In all FSD 11 versions.
18wcumo,kg1d3so,Troll

18wcumo,kfyl00j,"Ugh, following the law is sooooooo annoying"
18wcumo,kgk85tk,"Truth is, the time you think the car is taking at stop signs is recovered when the car accelerates back to the speed limit. In my experience with FSD Beta, after stopping at stop signs the car will usually accelerate quickly to get back up to speed, and an extra 3 seconds is more or less recovered‚Äînot that it really matters‚Äîit's 3 seconds y'all.

It might be awkward but it's really no big deal and it's technically the law. If everyone does something it doesn't mean you should follow suit. They think they're saving time by driving a certain way, when all they're doing is increasing risk to themselves and others‚Äîand I find using FSD Beta going the speed limit, I often catch up to the faster drivers at the next light. The difference is, I'm not stressing to be somewhere like they are as I know the time savings is a few short minutes at best. I just give myself enough time to make it safely and without stressing. If you were riding in the back of a robotaxi, you wouldn't notice or care about the legally required 3 seconds at stop signs. You'd be too buried in your phone."

18wcumo,kfxcys8,"What I don't understand is how the NHTSA can say you have to come to a complete stop at all stop signs instead of slowing to 1-2 mph but going 20 mph over the speed limit is fine!?! And not just Tesla's, with a Volvo you can set the cruise control to a max of 125 mph!"

18wcumo,kj79v5v,"Tesla ordered a voluntary recall (over the air update) to fix a ""problem"" with their automatic power windows. According to NHSTA standards the windows were too fast and may have prevented the windows from retracting quickly enough in the event a person was being pinched by the window.   


The media freaked out over the national recall; but by the time the media had even reported on the issue, it had been fixed and pushed to all cars. The real complaint here, in my eyes, is that the NHSTA/Auto Industry doesn't have a better term for problems that can be fixed with over the air updates. So, they call them national recalls. Traditionally, recalls have been a very bad thing and usually require a customer to take their car to a dealer to get the problem fixed.  


As soon as the ""big 3"" automakers have over the air updates and are utilizing software extensively in their vehicles this will change. Right now, Tesla is the only manufacturer able to respond to issues this quickly so everyone else is content with calling them ""recalls""."

I was referring to people that think they stopped, but didn't, which is usually who I encounter. not those who willfilly do it :).   But you are right, it is terribly inefficient. Roundabouts would certainly solve the need for this better. I went driving in Stockholm recently (NOT downtown) and found most of the roads I traveled on had zero stop signs, only roundabouts.  Still, in the context of FSD, I claim the car should obey the traffic laws 100% of the time, unless Tesla agrees to pay all your tickets, unless you explicitly tell it otherwise, for example the speed limit settings which do that."
18wcumo,kqx1p3x,"it will absolutely not. Every single time. Source: have tried it. does not work. And not even just sometimes. if there are no cars  it will not stop completely. If a car happens to be there, only then it will."
18wcumo,kfz9l1c,The problem is most people don't follow the law 100% of the time. They drive at speeds they feel are comfortable in a given situation. I actually watch other drivers to see how many come to a complete stop (when not waiting on another car or person) and it's close to 0%. We aren't talking about blowing through a stop sign at 10-15 mph but slowing to 1-2 mph and if completely clear then going which is what people do. This keeps traffic flowing in a human-like manner. Also NHTSA allows max speed to be above the legal speed limit so how is stop sign behavior any different???

18wcumo,kg2yvtv,"Tbh I don't know the speed, it's a rolling stop. Maybe 5mph is too fast. Not sure exactly, but it's a normal rolling stop. I could get a ticket, but I save on gas and it's not dangerous. If a pedestrian popped up that I didn't see, I'd be able to still top on a dime."

18wcumo,kfxtx7t,"It has been studied over and over (borderline beating a dead horse) that the biggest contributing factor to road safety is consistency and predictability.

All road laws exist because it‚Äôs an attempt to force a certain consistency in all drivers.

However stop signs laws is one of those things that pretty much all human drivers don‚Äôt follow. So ironically, not doing a complete stop is actually the consistent and predictable thing to do.

Tesla had data to back up this claim. They said that they had so much trouble training the car to do a completely stop because that kind of data barely exist. Only about 5% of their entire fleet actually made full stops at stop signs. Meaning only about 5% of human drivers are fully stopping at stop signs.

So if you follow the science and the studies of maintaining consistency and predictability for maximum safety, what the person you responded to said actually makes sense. Because it is in fact, scientifically safer to not fully stop (due to human behavior), regardless of the legal implications."

18wcumo,kfxo6s3,To be fair you‚Äôre definitely not the only one who thought that but I saw the interview and tweets musk said on the topic and it was always just v12 was going to be the version of the software that would come out of beta.

EDIT: Actually I could see it managing a traffic light controlled roundabout, but most are not traffic light controlled and require judgement."
18wcumo,kh3bn94,"Yeah I highly doubt it‚Äôll manage roundabouts here in Europe. I can‚Äôt even get down a single lane road with no traffic if the sun is low without it phantom braking badly because it can‚Äôt see‚Ä¶  annoying I can‚Äôt even use TACC in the same scenario either because it‚Äôs stupidly camera based like AP and phantom brakes in exactly the same spots. My Tesla is the only car where when using AP or TACC I have to hover the accelerator in case it dangerously decides to brake for no reason. My previous car and my wife‚Äôs current car use radar for the TACC so it‚Äôs rock solid and I can relax knowing it won‚Äôt slam the brakes on for no reason.

EDIT: AP is good on the motorway (highway) though. But again that‚Äôs just a straight line with speeding up and slowing down for traffic so it‚Äôs the bare minimum I‚Äôd expect really.

EDIT 2: AP is also very good at night because the above mentioned sun problem is obviously not there. However it would be nice if it could drive safely and comfortably in the day time too."

18wcumo,kg0y42h,"Blame/critique/whatever. It‚Äôs like reviewing a vehicle and saying one of the negatives is that it has side mirrors‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a requirement that they are forced to do, therefore not even worth mentioning imo - unless specifically pointing out that the requirement is dumb. 
If OP had said ‚ÄòI wish this wasn‚Äôt how FSD operated at stop lights, NHTSA should stop forcing Tesla to do this‚Äô I think it‚Äôd be better."
18wcumo,kopg40g,"By which measurement? Speed of tires/axle can be zero without the body of the vehicle/occupant being zero... Most wheel speed sensors will err on the side of reading faster than actual speed. Tire size and inflation changes your speed... With momentum the driver could never hit 0 velocity while the tires technically do...

And what someone feels is zero can be different than what actually is. The point I'm making is you can argue about what a stop really is and how long it should take for safety. And id bet NHTSA is forcing Tesla to take the longest possible definition of a stop, which may seem annoying to actual customers."
18wcumo,kqyn62h,You have a very special version or something is broken it seems. Full stop at recognized stop signs is essentially hard coded in 11. There is no variation in behavior if the sign is recognized as a stop sign applying to ego and there are no driver inputs. Can you post a video of this behavior?
18wcumo,kfzcgu5,"> I actually watch other drivers to see how many come to a complete stop (when not waiting on another car or person) and it's close to 0%. 

Indeed and occasionally you'll see traffic police stake out an intersection and fine everyone running the stop sign. How would you feel about being fined for the behavior programmed into an autopilot? Will the car manufacturer pay the fine? 

Never mind running the stop sign causing an incident which is yet another issue etc etc.

re: speed limits; maybe that's not a good idea either. 

If we're going to have traffic rules and going to have autonomous vehicles on the road, those autonomous vehicles should follow the rules even if other vehicles on the road don't. It's bad enough that human drivers cut you off, let's not have robots do that too, eh?"

18wcumo,kfyfx17,"This is something that 'scares' me, should FSD ever come to Germany. If Tesla uses bad material for training, without being able to implant the StVO (Stra√üenverkehrsordnung = Road Traffic Act) that it will behave like an asshole in traffic.

Some examples I am afraid of, the FSD will mimic:
- On the German Autobahn, where there are 3 or more lanes in one direction, there are annoyingly many drivers thinking the right lane is for Trucks only, and subsequently stay in the middle lane. The StVO however clearly states, outside of city limits you shall always drive in the right most lane, and also drive right most in your lane. Further does it state, when passing one shall not stay longer than 20 seconds in the passing lane when there is no traffic on the lane to their right.
- In stop and go traffic, one shall form the emergency lane, by driving even further right in their lane, including partially crossing into the adjacent lane if it is save to do so; and if you are in the left most lane, you are supposed to drive left most.

There is many more I feel FSD would screw up on Germany streets, but these two were the ones immediately coming to mind."

NHTSA made them take it away.

18wcumo,kfzgykx,"I would be ecstatic if the NHTSA would treat stop sign behavior like speed limits. Currently we can set a speed limit offset to go above the speed limit and the driver (or owner) would get a ticket. Add a similar setting for stop sign offset to either 0, 1 or 2 through stops signs only when completely clear and the driver would get the ticket if they chose to enable it.   


For cutting off other drivers, I don't see them actually programming that because most people don't do that. The only other area I see where fsd differs from humans is where it stops at a stop sign. By the law, you must stop before the stop sign or white line if present then creep for visibility. Most people if intersection is clear of pedestrians, will stop where they have enough visibility to see to proceed which may be beyond the stop sign."

That was never my experience.  If it's going to miss a stop sign, you know *well* ahead of time (I have an intersection where it used to do that).

aeb7ui,edo0158,It's basically a smaller Model S
aeb7ui,ednxq0b,I don't understand why you were so offended? There are differences sure but just looking at it the 3 is smaller than the S is it not? 
aeb7ui,edo094c,"If she hypothetically calls a Civic a smaller Accord then calling a 3 smaller S seems perfectly apt to me. 


IMO you've defined the phrase differently but didn't provide any argument to why your definition is better or why she should use yours. "

I laughed and just said, ""Nope. Want to drag race?"""
aeb7ui,edo372q,She's not really that far off... yes for a quick description that's perfectly fitting. For a longer conversation you can go into differences but yeah generally it's a smaller S.
aeb7ui,edntyep,"Well... should have told her that ""no, can't you see - it's a completely different color!""
*ducks*"
aeb7ui,edp09dq,That sounds a little tesla-elitist.  In the grand scheme of things it is basically a smaller model s.  Fast 4 door electric car with similar body designs. Big touchscreen. Only to enthusiasts are they vastly different. 
aeb7ui,edo4za2,"‚ÄúHow do you like your model 3?‚Äù

*‚ÄùHow dare you address me.‚Äù*

That generally takes care of it. "
aeb7ui,ednwjpy,"I don't think her description was that out of place. There are more similarities between the two cars than differences. If you look at these two statements, some people might argue that the first statement sounds more correct than the second one. 

* Model 3 is just a smaller version of the Model S
* Model 3 and Model S are different cars

I disagree with Tesla trying to present the Model S as a more premium car. The main reason Model S is more expensive than Model 3 is that the Model S production line is only 28% as efficient as Toyota (the NUMMI factory) whereas the Model 3 production line is 64% as efficient as Toyota. In other words, the Model 3 production line is more than twice as efficient as Model S in terms of cars produced per employee per year. 

Your examples of other brands don't feel right because both the 3 and the S use the same cabin materials and have the same essential features like Autopilot. 

I have heard many people describe the Model Y as a smaller version of Model X similar to how Model 3 is a smaller version of Model S. This sounds correct to me."

It pisses me off when someone is driving next to another car and put on their turn signal but continue to blithely drive at the same speed as the car next to them thinking their turn signal is going to magically open a space for them. No, it‚Äôs not the other car‚Äôs duty to move for you. Find a space, put on your turn signal to alert other drivers to your move, then change lanes. "

abmxx2,ed3m453,"It seems you fundamentally do not understand what indicators are for.

They are stating intent, not action. If I have my indicator on, it's because I intend to change lanes in that direction, or making a turn.

As for who's responsibility it is to make space. It's everyone's responsibility to be courteous to others on the road. Sometimes that's means finding an empty space, sometimes that means making space for others if safe to do so. "

4ewa59,d23vei2,"Good question. Companies don't need to apply to use Tesla's patents or state publicly that they are using any of Tesla's patented technology so we don't really know for sure.

In November 2015 during an interview with Ron Baron, Tesla CEO Elon Musk very briefly mentioned for the first time that [he believes companies are now using Tesla‚Äôs patents](http://electrek.co/2015/11/10/a-number-of-companies-are-now-using-teslas-open-source-patents-and-it-has-some-interesting-implications/):

> ‚ÄúI think actually there are a number of companies using our patents.‚Äù

I think the main reason why some companies, especially established automakers, could be reluctant to use Tesla's patents is the ‚Äúgood faith‚Äù clause in its ‚Äú[Patent Pledge](https://www.teslamotors.com/about/legal#patent-pledge)‚Äù

> Tesla‚Äôs definition of ‚Äúacting in good faith‚Äù depends solely on three things a party wanting to use Tesla‚Äôs patents for free can not do:
> 
> * asserted, helped others assert or had a financial stake in any assertion of (i) any patent or other intellectual property right against Tesla or (ii) any patent right against a third-party for its use of technologies relating to electric vehicles or related equipment;
> 
> * challenged, helped others challenge, or had a financial stake in any challenge to any Tesla patent; or
> 
> * marketed or sold any knock-off product (e.g., a product created by imitating or copying the design or appearance of a Tesla product or which suggests an association with or endorsement by Tesla) or provided any material assistance to another party doing so.
> 
> In other words, if a company wants to use Tesla‚Äôs patents for free, they cannot sue Tesla for infringement of their own patents, which has some interesting implications since a legal action is the main, if not only mean to enforce intellectual property rights.

It's not entirely clear, but the language opens the door to Tesla using the patents of companies actively using theirs - without fear of repercussions.

Of course it sounds fair, but I can see how some companies wouldn't like that and wouldn't risk it. "
4ewa59,d241l7u,Not a car manufacturer but recently I started looking at all their patents to use some of their technologies. They are extremely detailed in how to produce a lot of parts and components.
4ewa59,d245oya,"In business it's perceived as a a good strategy to develop proprietary technology if it's hard to replicate. If a company thinks it can out battery engineer Tesla and develop another method, it will not use Tesla's patents. It will develop and patent its own. While this sort of assumption, *out battery engineering Tesla*, is ludicrous to us, it's rational to many automotive boardroom members. Who tend to lean towards ""we can do it better than everyone else"" even at their own peril. The concept of sharing in the business world, without a legally agreed upon money exchanging arrangement, is rather unwelcomed."

It seems to mean others can't defend their own EV related patents as well."
4ewa59,d23wxr1,"I doubt that is the legal interpretation.  Assert-ed, help-ed, and had all imply past tense, not future.  They can't have sued Tesla in the past, but they could in the future."
4ewa59,d24l7fy,"Sorry im not familar at all with patent laws. 

But does this mean that if a company wishes to use their patents for free they can do so ? Or does it mean that tesla will basically let anyone licence their patents as long as they use them in good faith ? 

Would a company using them have to pay royalty fees ?

So are they genuinely open source (as long as people 'act in good faith')"
4ewa59,d24dlt7,"> While this sort of assumption, out battery engineering Tesla, is ludicrous to us, it's rational to many automotive boardroom members.

But in GM's case, didn't LG's latest battery (Bolt) indeed come in with similar density and cost to Tesla's? The Bolt's 60kWh pack weighs less per kWh than Tesla's, and its cost per kWh is in line with where Tesla's is estimated to be. Not saying it exceeds Tesla but seems within spitting distance, and certainly better than anyone seemed to be expecting. So in that case was GM really so irrational?"

This would mean that if you use any technology covered by Tesla's patents and then sue or help others sue Tesla, your license is forfeit. Tesla is covering their bases here, as many companies often ""sell"" or loan their patents to [joint ventures and IP holding companies](https://theumlaut.com/2013/10/02/patent-privateers/) and then unleash them upon their competitors without having to worry about poor publicity or retribution (patent infringement countersuits)."

1bl5lx2,kwdsm0o,"Yes, you can only change once the warning pops up"

165kvv4,jyesmn1,I like the throttle mapping on Chill but it needs to give full power near the end of pedal travel. I tried it for a bit but not being able to access full power in an emergency is dumb.
165kvv4,jyejuse,"I just have control over my foot and accelerator pedal. I can driver nice and smooth in the city and have lots of power for merging onto the highway ramp. I used to switch back and forth but now I just leave it on standard. 

I‚Äôd vote but I don‚Äôt understand the choices."
165kvv4,jyen0k3,The problem with Chill mode is it also reduces your regen by a significant amount. I can always tell when my car hasn't swapped from my teenaged son's profile to mine because the car coasts much more a low speeds on his profile in Chill than on mine in standard.
165kvv4,jyexnc8,Yeah. This is why I don‚Äôt use chill. Most cars just remap the accelerator pedal. Tesla went a different route ofcourse.
165kvv4,jyggl9c,"I use the S3XY buttons, the OBD receiver has an option for kickdown which essentially enables insane mode when you depress the pedal to 90%

Other than that I keep it in chill which keeps me from getting nauseous from all the jerky starts"
165kvv4,jyekuz2,"The names of each Tesla mode are in the rap lyric titles. Choose your favorite mode. 

 I was feeling a little creative. LOL. 

To that end, I guess I get all my acceleration fun and knife edge response from riding liter bikes and super sports, or tearing around in the 392, that I enjoy having something where I do not have manage precision throttle input when driving."
165kvv4,jygitz9,"They never ""coast"", the motor always regenerates when slowing so from a given speed it's the same energy gained (stopping in Hold mode without using the brake pedal)."
165kvv4,jygo28m,"Interesting. I‚Äôve never really noticed any discernible difference between chill mode and the other modes in terms of regenerative braking. Only when it was charged over 95%, in which case I had to activate the ‚Äúapply braking‚Äù mode."
165kvv4,jygxf4w,"You are incorrect when regen is on chill. The cars do in effect coast. Try it out. Put your car in chill and slowly move around in your driveway. Feel how much more the car moves when you lift your foot off the accelerator. Then take it out of chill and do the same. The car moves noticeably different.

My son and I have almost exactly the same seat, mirror and wheel position in our profiles. When it doesn't change from his to mine, I can tell not by those other things, but how the car moves in the first few minutes as I'm moving the car out of our garbage and into our tight inner city alley."
165kvv4,jygzerv,"It may decelerate slower with ""chill"" (that's the point of chill) but it's the same amount of energy given back to the battery. Think I'm defining ""regen"" as energy recaptured for additional range and you're defining ""regen"" as braking speed."
165kvv4,jyh0cpt,"Rate of regen is lower making the car move more distance when the accelerator is released. Sure, you would eventually get the same energy out of the ""braking"" process but on chill you'll really need to lift off the accelerator really early to come to a full stop and I imagine many people would end up needing to apply the physical brake losing some energy they could have recaptured with more aggressive regen.

So, yes, we were taking 2 different trains of thought about regen."

14umkh9,jr8z5il,"Praying one of these days soon FSD will start to decelerate for stopped/slowing cars and red lights /stop signs much sooner so it doesn't always slam on full Regen and friction brakes at the last second only to then very slowly creep to the stop point and then finally stopping 10 feet behind where it should really stop with a hard friction brake mini slam at the end to complete the stop. Especially while in chill mode.

95%+ of the stops FSD does when going over ~35mph do this for every FSD build I've ever tested the past 18 months. Wish Tesla would solve the basics like a smooth deceleration profile before it attempted things like unprotected lefts. Hopefully the AP3 cameras can see far enough ahead to know it needs to slow down instead of continuing to accelerate for things."
14umkh9,jr8f7pi,I just want it to stop turning into every turn lane and bypass. Regardless of minimum lane change or any other setting.
14umkh9,jrawb1l,Making proper lane changes and fix stopping completely at 90 degree turns/curves that don‚Äôt have traffic signs would be nice
14umkh9,jr8bs8g,So.... Same notes as  11.4.4?
14umkh9,jrqd9vu,I just want my money back at this point.
14umkh9,jr9v4rs,"I am holding my breath until I see ""no lane change"" option."
14umkh9,jrwdknv,Anybody has any idea when this is going to out to original testers?
14umkh9,jsa76ti,Will this ever release? Been so long since an update and also would like to join the current branch to!
14umkh9,jr9nn6f,"Then take off incredibly slowly only to start gunning it to close the gap, pissing off the guy behind you who is now trying to pass.  Then come full circle by slowing late with full regen/brakes..."
14umkh9,js14vcv,I don‚Äôt think we see a big improvement until HW4 with high resolution cameras.  I think it approximates until it gets close enough to know exactly when to stop‚Ä¶.but just a total guess
14umkh9,jrbelzd,I have completely stopped using it on certain roads because of this behavior. It's incredibly dangerous when there's cars behind you and it looks like you're leaving the roadway only to immediately swerve back in after taking over control of the car.
14umkh9,jr8lqdj,Yes. That‚Äôs what the website says.
14umkh9,jr92fze,"From likn in post ""This FSD Beta update is a bugfix release and focuses on improving the driving experience. The release notes remain the same as the previous FSD Beta 11.4.4. This beta is currently being tested by employees. """
14umkh9,js14xok,Why bought into a beta product with tons info online that tells you exactly how good and bad it is
14umkh9,jrc346k,"When I put it in chill and minimize lane change the car will camp in a lane for 10 mi stuck in stop and go traffic even though the lane next to it is open. It will not change lanes unless it's to follow course.  Once you get out of chill mode though, even with minimize lane changes, then it decides it needs to change lanes and the problem presents itself."
14umkh9,jse06zf,"Seems very delayed. Elon was talking about how they ""solved"" the problem so they might be busy trying to switch architecture once again.

Or just 11.4.5 is buggy."
14umkh9,js29xws,You‚Äôre making some modern day assumptions here.   Many do when it comes to us FSD crybabies.    Some of us purchased in pre 2020 when The RocketMan over promised (over and over and over) when FSD would be full featured.    Either he lied or he is one of the most misinformed CEOs to ever grace a press conference.
14umkh9,jrgdjn3,"Under Navigation, disable ""Use HOV lanes"" and enable ""Avoid Tolls"" if you haven't already. I found this to help."
14umkh9,js3rgwd,"I purchase EAP in 2017 while he was promising the world.  The evidence wasn‚Äôt there to suggest it was going to happen anytime soon.  I‚Äôve since upgraded to HW3 and FSD knowing that it‚Äôs not feature complete, but it exceeds my expectations and Elon will just co tubule to blow more smoke up everyones asses about it being done by EOY.  It‚Äôs a beta product and always has been, so I would never buy into it with any expectation it will get you where you need to go without issues and interventions.

Never buy into hype if you expect something that doesn‚Äôt exist yet.  I made that mistake but an entire Ring security setup and cameras because they said HomeKit was coming soon.  It never surfaced.  Buy based on what you expect the product to have today because it may never get any better"
1c4n8q6,kzollra,"I'm not a fan of the new auto speed either. Especially hate that when auto is off, it still behaves the same way. 

For the most part, I travel +14% of the speed limit. That puts me at a pace that doesn't cause excessive speed over the limit, as in , I won't stand out. 

Problem is, you're right ... On my way to work, there is a section that is heavily patrolled and is 25. Sometimes we're good right at 25-29, and other times, it shoots up to 40. I've had to slow it immediately since the scroll does nothing now. 

I definitely don't like this and believe if FSD is supervised, then we should have control over this."
1c4n8q6,kzpdy8a,Night driving is the worse because my car seems to drive more aggressively for some reason. It‚Äôs also when the roads are empty. If you‚Äôre going to go 40+ on a 35 that‚Äôs usually fine when you‚Äôre following the flow of traffic but when it‚Äôs just you on the road and you pass by a cop going 43-47mph you risk getting a ticket.
1c4n8q6,kzqrctx,"I got a speed camera ticket my second day of the free trial. I scrolled the wheel down to the school zone limit (20 MPH) plenty far in advance but it was going 26 MPH when it passed the camera. I specifically was driving without the ""auto speed"" mode so I could override it for speed cameras. Yeah I know -- I'm responsible. Should have slammed the brakes I guess when I realized it wasn't going to obey my set limit. Oh well."
1c4n8q6,kzolr4b,"Driving in the city with FSD, I'm taking over about once every two minutes. Not because it's unsafe or breaking laws, but because it's headed for a pothole, or being inconsiderate of other drivers, or there's an abnormal situation up ahead that I'm not positive it's going to manage successfully because I've only used it for a few days ...

  
It's not perfect, but it's learning."
1c4n8q6,kzrqmku,I welcome this aggressiveness but only in assertive mode
1c4n8q6,kzp7n3c,It‚Äôs a setting in the FSD Menu
1c4n8q6,kzpaebw,"I just disconnect FSD when I enter a zone like that. Regenerating slows me quickly.  Then once at the desired speed, reengage."
1c4n8q6,kzsv8r8,I‚Äôve had the opposite problem it try‚Äôs to merge into freeway at 25mph
1c4n8q6,kzoowlx,"Turn off auto speed, set your buffer as you like"
1c4n8q6,l01va5p,"I have to disengage 3x on my commute to work, bc speed limit goes 55-45-55-45-55-45 through towns.

It will keep rolling 55 through town without a care. 

FSD 11 had no issues taking me to work at all."
1c4n8q6,kzqxo1k,Good to know Teslas are speeding through school zones uncontrollably
1c4n8q6,kzv9ivo,Brake.
1c4n8q6,kzq9x33,Tried it off and it still speeds. Something about the recent update is off. I can only use FSD on highways since city streets here in NYC has speed cameras I‚Äôll be getting one each block.
1c4n8q6,kzop1a3,I will try this next time I drive but I recall someone saying this happens even with auto speed off.
1c4n8q6,kzr0ct2,"Wouldn't call it uncontrollably. You just press the brake pedal. Just inconvenient when we are being sold ""full self driving""."
1c4n8q6,kzwqv4d,"Wow what a novel idea! I wish I thought of that! 

Gosh what other amazing info can you impart to me, oh wise sage?"
1c4n8q6,kzp7pzt,"Yup, still happens for me with auto speed off. It was doing 37mph in a 25mph, and I had the scroll wheel set to 30mph max."
12bi3bx,jewwyip,"Keep in mind that the goal is to have cars that are safer than humans.

While most won't disagree with you about how everyone else just does rolling stops, the goal is to make the car conform to the rules of the road, not the ""commonly agreed upon/understand 'rules' of the road"".

There might come a time when Tesla can relax this, but for now, I'd get comfortable with this."
12bi3bx,jex2lqq,You can just lightly push on the accelerator in order to roll through the stop. Nothing is forcing you to use FSD exclusively. You are asking a safety system to break the rules of the road and upset when it won't without your intervention.
12bi3bx,jez11zt,"So you want your car to never exceed the posted speed limit? Keep talking and you will get it!
 Complaints like yours is why we keep loosing options and getting more rules applied. Think before you say things especially on open forums like this!!"
12bi3bx,jezi46e,"Yep. It's near unusable at stop signs. If I have to tap the accelerator every time I'll just drive myself.

The slowness of FSD is my number 1 priority issue of all that needs to be fixed to make this software usable. Going slow is more dangerous. Facts. But those frauds at the NHTSA need a job üôÑ"
12bi3bx,jex6to7,"Agreed.  You hit the nail on the head with allowing to adjust speed above the speed limit being allowed but not rolling stops.

That's a user's choice (to speed).

IMO, they need to make this an opt in switch under FSD settings: ""Allow rolling stops when safe to do so"" (with appropriate legalize).

And before everyone freaks out: back in the early days of Beta when we had rolling stops it wouldn't do a rolling stop when other cars were at the intersection.  It would do it when no other cars were present and *maybe* if a car was quite far from the intersection but approaching it.

And we're not talking a 4+ mph rolling stop, it was IIRC around 2mph."
12bi3bx,jex0teg,Would be nice if you could ‚Äúopt out‚Äù of recall updates. You effectively could in the past by not bringing your car in.
12bi3bx,jex0x00,[deleted]
12bi3bx,jex73gb,But speeding is a rule of the road but NHTSA allows that to be overridden and broken and that's what annoys me the most.
12bi3bx,jex6pli,I agree that we can tap the accelerator to have it go but my point is that from NHTSA's prospective speeding or rolling stops are both technically illegal but they allow one to be configured to be overridden but not the other.
12bi3bx,jexkgly,"Not to mention that Tesla had already changed fsd to stop at stop signs, it stopped for only a fraction of a second but it did stop. This wasn‚Äôt good enough for nhsta though. They complained about ‚Äúperceived‚Äù stop, so Tesla changed it to about two seconds which is way too long."
12bi3bx,jexcfod,Another human-like behavior I wished it did was not always stop before the stop sign when safe to do so with no people or other cars and in front of it. Most humans slow to a stop when they have a clear view of oncoming traffic. I never observer a human stop before the sign then creep forward to gain visibility.
12bi3bx,jex7jc8,Yeah my dad told me when learning to drive that being a predictable driver is a safe driver. I could be wrong but never heard or anyone getting a ticket from slowing to a couple mph when stopping unless they flat out blow through a stop sign.
12bi3bx,jex7m43,"I don't disagree.

The state of Florida has a [law](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0300-0399/0318/Sections/0318.18.html) which states that up to 5mph over the limit is a warning, but once you hit 6mph, you get a fine.

So, *legally* there's a buffer there.  I would be fine with a ""max"" of a +5mph speed limit offset, but using percentage *sucks* because I often end up ""outside"" the +5mph buffer."
12bi3bx,jexdo4p,"Yeah if they could bring that back with a caveat something like + x mph but not greater than + y %.

Also on a side note, I wish valet mode and speed limit mode used a % offset and/or max speed, so you can't go 70 in a 25."
12bi3bx,jeyo59b,"Interesting read.

I noted that you can still be fined $50 for 1 to 5 mph in a school zone or an ""enhanced penalty zone"".  And they call 1 to 5mph a ""moving violation involving unlawful speed"", so it's illegal even when you're just given a warning."
12bi3bx,jeyoev8,"I was on an HOA and had to learn some of the HOA laws, and now I find shit like this fun to read through, because I can be like ""You can't do this to me"", lol.

Laws a fun, when you know/understand them."
1cw5wb5,l4txjfy,The current behavior *is* the fix. FSD got recalled a while back for running yellow lights. Now it only sometimes runs them.
1cw5wb5,l4tzs2r,This is actually the law in some states. Look up restrictive vs permissive yellow lights.
1cw5wb5,l4vgv4g,It's scary and I feel like v12 creates a lot more risk of being rear ended at stop signs and lights. It's unpredictable and makes unnatural decisions.
1cw5wb5,l4w7ypg,"I was assuming they just dialed back the ""run yellow light"" out of caution during v12 rollout and they would eventually tweak it back up again. 

Seems like the car can just compute based on speed, distance, and length of the yellow whether or not to stop. This calculation doesn't need AI and should be relatively simple to do, with a variable for max g force when stopping and other parameters that can be tuned for max safety and comfort."
1cw5wb5,l4u1219,"Same thing happened with rolling stops at stop signs and right turns. Tesla had data that showed that something like 98% of drivers roll stops and the government stepped in and said the rules are thst you have to come to a complete stop and wait two seconds.¬†¬†

¬†A human, in theory, needs to do that to be safe. But a computer with no blind spot and a processor capable of 140 trillion operations per second does not need this requirement. So fucking stupid.¬†"
1cw5wb5,l4u12v3,"Damn, the Jenny Hayden (Starman) setting has been removed?

https://youtu.be/g3WtvzmKCQQ?feature=shared"
1cw5wb5,l580z1u,It's end-to-end ML. There's no explicit calculations like that.
ylmp0q,iuzac6h,Anybody else experiencing this? just happened at 0.2mi out
ylmp0q,iuzej3w,"10.69.2.x still makes all kinds of poor lane decisions, but in my experience, whether it‚Äôs left, right, up or down depends on your particular area.  I‚Äôve seen it all.

I do wish it‚Äôd honor the ‚Äúconfirm lane changes‚Äù setting from Navigate on Autopilot."
ylmp0q,iuzktf4,"Yes, this happens to me all the time.  When it chooses the right lane it does well, but it constantly gets in the wrong lane and changes lanes back and forth for absolutely no reason.  I have studied Open Maps and cant find anything that is wrong on it on the mapping data.

Lately, it's also making turns that veer into the other lane or outside the lines and has to swerve back right away."
ylmp0q,iuzod8x,"Mine got in the right, my left turn was coming in about 2 miles.  The right was going to slow so it got back in the left.  It got back in the right about 0.5 miles before my left turn, then immediately got back in the left lane.   The other drivers around me were not amused."
ylmp0q,iuzl1qa,Yeah I made a post about this as well. Poor lane choices all the time =\
ylmp0q,iuzns6u,"My experience is that if you let it go in the wrong lane and then move it back to the correct lane it stays there.

If you tell it not to go to the other lane it just keeps trying and trying and trying.

It's particularly annoying when he can't make the turn after the bad lane choice.

Just keep hitting that report camera icon. Somebody will count how many reports they get where lane changes were overridden. They are working on getting better lane connectivity as discussed at AI day."
ylmp0q,iv2t71a,"Yeah all the time my FSD will switch lanes when it doesn't need to or even it will say change lanes to follow route when I don't need to change lanes to follow my route.

Also too whether it's a right hand turn or left hand turn it will just randomly get over into the opposite lane when my turn is coming up.

I think an easy fix for this is to do it like they do on the freeway where I have it set that I have to confirm myself if I want to change the lane instead of it just Auto doing when you're on City streets.

I'm not sure how the system you text for this is it if you're going over a certain speed limit or does it know that you're on the freeway and won't change late without your confirmation?

Also too I'll be on the freeway where it can't do its own lane changes it has to confirm with me first and then I press the stock but sometimes I'll just randomly get the lane change icon and the sound to come up for like two or three clicks and then it shuts off again without me even pressing the stock."
ylmp0q,iuzvpfh,"is this on 10.69.3?  
because this version seems to improve lane decision making a lot"
ylmp0q,iv2cybt,"Yeah, stuff like dodging into left-turn only lanes instead of staying in the thru-lane is a perennial issue. And about 25% of the time, at the entrance to my subdivision, it goes into the right-turn lane instead of the center turn lane (it‚Äôs a left-hand turn!)

Personally I wish FSD would not do any non-navigation-essential lane changes when in chill mode - because it apparently has the patience of a toddler."
ylmp0q,iv37ylq,This has been happening for the past couple versions. It'll even wait till the last second - I had it make a right turn from the left lane.
ylmp0q,iv3hans,Same here. Just finished a drive where it moved me to left lane just before a right turn.
ylmp0q,iv1ai5z,"Woow...and that's what folks are ""bleeding out"" $15,000 and counting for????üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±"
ylmp0q,iv04sg3,"Same, the stupid logic is that stay/switch to the right, but once you‚Äôre about .5 miles to your left turn, then start to switch."
ylmp0q,iv0sjgc,"Yes, and all the ‚Äúchange to follow lane‚Äù without any good reason!"
ylmp0q,iv35ipo,Curious ‚Ä¶ what driving profile are you on? Chill mode has made it so this rarely ever happens.
ylmp0q,iv3v5pm,"Yes! This drives me crazy! I also noticed the headlight pop up menu appears randomly when I engage FSD. Also the wipers will begin cleaning my windshield when I engage FSD after washing my car, even though the windshield is dry. I haven‚Äôt tested this since the 2022.20.19 update tho.

Update: windshield cleaning bug still present after 2022.20.19 (FSD 10.60.2.4). It‚Äôs really annoying."

ylmp0q,iv09oon,Goodbye Reddit
ylmp0q,iv11hs4,This 100%. I don't understand why they went with the stupid profiles. They don't seem to do shit IMO. I just want FSD Beta to respect my Autopilot options. Stay in the left lane and no speed based lane changes.
ylmp0q,iv141ry,"my guess is the transformer they're using for lane geometry just isn't trained with diverse enough data, because in some instances its just beautiful, and in others it looks like beta from a year ago"

ylmp0q,iv11if6,üôÉ
ylmp0q,iv2ss7a,Question how do you send feedback to Tesla on any issues while doing fsd? I didn't know that you could do something on the screen.
ylmp0q,iv1zbo6,Oh I am aware. I've been a fsd beta tester for 1 year. Literally no one else has any similar or better product out on the market for consumers so I'm not sure what you are all up about. Yeah it's taking longer than he said but it's getting done and before anyone else will.
ylmp0q,iv3qxum,"I‚Äôd rather be on assertive for other reasons but I don‚Äôt doubt it‚Äôs different.

ylmp0q,iv1l0pt,I'm sure it will improve over time. I'm just not sure the improvements will be based on our feedback anymore. I imagine it was a lot to keep up with before they let more people into the program.
ylmp0q,iv3jxlt,"When in ""fsd beta"" there should be a video-camera icon somewhere on the upper left side of the screen. Pressing it would record a clip of the past few seconds to submit to the fsd beta team. To further clarify you could also send an email with your information (date, time, vin, ect.) to explain the error.

Now I'm assuming with 100,000 + beta users they can't possibly keep up with these clips, & honestly I don't know if they could before. (hence the button supposedly doing nothing now) Surely they have a system to filter areas or types of events, but we can only speculate."
ylmp0q,iv3nzu7,Still NOT worth milking gullible ppl for $15k!! just to get a beta version of some software!! NO way can that be justified! EAP wlda been the route to take..then once FSD is actually a viable product charge for it! Do u actually think any govt wld sign off on real FSD?? Hell naw..not in the next 5 yrs they won't . Can down vote all u want ..sorry i am not as gullible and can smell a snake oil salesman from a mile away!
ylmp0q,iv3ruu0,"Curious what those other reasons are? I extensively tried all 3 modes, and found both assertive and average to do nothing different other than incredibly stupid decisions. Especially without radar, it often thinks cars are stopped when they‚Äôre not. The only real difference I saw with chill is that it creates a greater follow distance, but I don‚Äôt mind that. It‚Äôs less than 1 car length and leads to smoother braking.

Edit: if it‚Äôs saying follow route, my ‚Äúsolution‚Äù may be useless to you. There‚Äôs a section of the 405 N before the 101 interchange where autopilot thinks it HAS to be in the carpool lane to follow the route. It has an exit < 3 miles out and has to get over 5 lanes. Fun times."
ylmp0q,iv48c1f,Ya I would usually leave them on so it never occurred to me that FSD would be switching them on. But ya they flicker off and on way too often!

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

I started fast, tried chill for a while, then went back

ylmp0q,iv3uvff,Time for you to become the new Chuck Cook!
ylmp0q,ivj42wo,"üòÇ anyways that's good to know. Yeah I would hope that they have basically oh hey we don't have that many people that are testing it here in this area or the state so let's get data from there.

Where I'm at in Utah there's quite a few overpasses that you like go underneath and on the sides of the overpass are the stop lights but then as you get underneath the overpass now you have two turn Lanes from people coming off of the off ramps from either direction and each side has two separate lights with arrows depending on where you are parked so you can see them.

If the lights on the overpass are green I'll get underneath the overpass and it sees those two red light turn arrows and then it tries to want to slow down and stop they're usually after it hits to the second red arrow light cuz they're probably only about like 10 to 15 ft apart from each other on each side. But it's just one of those weird situations where it doesn't know what to do. Same when you're coming off of the freeway there if you're in the inner Lane it's pretty good about doing the turn but if you're in the outside turn lane there's only the inner dotted lines there's no separate ones on the right side so it tends to want to go out farther into the lane which would result in you hitting the other car coming off the off front from the other side.

But there's some other just areas that aren't normal they need to be addressed so I've been submitting these different things.

Like also some speed bumps or getting into a business it doesn't slow down to go into those and I've found some deep ones where it's bottomed out and stuff. Same like on residential street just sometimes see speedoms and it won't slow down or some railroad tracks it won't slow down for it and it's got like a ramp on it and if you were to just keep going you would catch some air on the train tracks but then there's others where it does slow down so it's interesting.

But when doing that snapshot what does it actually doing is it recording the last few seconds of video or what?

Also if it actually is doing what it's supposed to be doing as far as when you take the snapshot because you say that they may not even be using these anymore. But if it's doing what it's supposed to it like uploads those to the Tesla server so they can look at them? And does it send those when it's connected to Wi-Fi I guess?"
ylmp0q,ivjem42,"https://twitter.com/greentheonly/status/1586438281671348225?t=nflvdfDz4weuD1K8vjvpmA&s=19

So this is as much information as I have. From what I understand, pressing the snapshot may actually do nothing at the moment & the record function may actually be random, but it also may record the last few seconds. If you watch Tesla's AI day presentation it actually shows that they can do an insane amount of sampling to the point of reconstructing a virtual intersection. In the end your guess is as good as mine."
1bhzrwz,kvnooqq,Yes!!! So frustrating.  Drives 10MPH below the speed limit.  Sometime more!!
1bhzrwz,kw0xwtj,"Is this a systemic issue, is everyone experiencing?"
1bhzrwz,kw1sp93,Absolutely having the same issue and it is incredibly frustrating! I have to press the accelerator pedal to coax it up to the speed limit.
1bhzrwz,kxfmibz,"Yes, it's an issue for everyone. I got the new beta and took a 3 hour trip. It was constantly driving below my max driving speed -- if not slower than the speed limit itself. I set myself to aggressive and it still didn't matter. Too bad because otherwise its a huge improvement forward, but the speed issue certainly is annoying."
1bhzrwz,kwd8g2a,Same here. Just got the update today - first thing I noticed. Fixed a bunch of other FSD issues tho but it's pretty annoying.
1bhzrwz,kx0i0u0,"Yes it's a problem. In my experience I can jog its memory by stepping on the accelerator and getting back to my set speed. It then holds the speed for a few minutes then starts to slow down again.

I also have a problem with US rt5 signs. Nellie thinks it's a 5mph sign. If I step on the accelerator Nellie says oh crap sorry and sets the speed back to the actual speed limit.!!??"
1bhzrwz,kx7ms9b,I changed my drive style to most aggressive which seems to help quite a bit but not completely perfect as it would sometimes go to 25mph.
1bhzrwz,kzheulk,"Same experience with 12.3.3 for me. It does not reach set speed. It's especially frustrating in traffic because it falls away from the car in front of me. On winding back roads it sometimes won't keep up with the traffic even after dialing up the speed. For example, it wouldn't keep up with three vehicles being held back by a semi truck."
1bhzrwz,kw8c7j7,"I'm not sure, part of why I am asking. Does anyone know a way of fixing it, short of 'press on accelerator'? At the moment FSD is unusable for me because of the frustration for other drivers."
1c5i8iw,kzv0761,"Yeah I just use the brake pedal to slow down, kicking it out of FSD, which then prompts me to give feedback, which I then do."
1c5i8iw,kzysgwp,Same here
1c5i8iw,kzu9bsx,Interesting because i definitely can not. The scroll wheel does nothing when auto /max is displayed. In some cases when the auto/max is not shown like on the highway the scroll wheel works . I have a 2024 model y long range
1c5i8iw,l3knntr,"The latest FSD version is terrible at maintaining and changing speeds, especially on two lane roads.  Previous versions held the set speed perfectly while the current version varies as much as 5 mph below the set speed. It takes forever to slow down when the limit reduces.  I thought the NTSB forced Tesla to fix this back in version 11.  What happened with version 12?"
1c5i8iw,l4b9naf,Sorry this is off-topic to OP but can we address often going slower than speed limit when in assertive?
1c5i8iw,kzu7r0e,You can use the scroll wheel to decrease the speed
1c5i8iw,kzuhcda,"Same here. Only way I can stop it from going 68 in a 40 sometimes is to kick it out of FSD entirely. FSD 12 has been much improved, but worse and kind of scary compared to previous versions in some ways tbh."
1c5i8iw,kzu7wyk,Not the case any more when it shows auto/Max . This is on the latest release
1c5i8iw,kzu9121,I have the latest version too and use FSD everyday. Never had a problem with that. 2024 MYRWD. yes by default it selects Max speed but I am able to change it through the scroll wheel
1c5i8iw,kzui9mm,"It sounds like you haven't been able to access the auto speed limit feature under the autopilot menu. Full Self-Driving (FSD) now detects the speeds that other vehicles have driven in the area, and your car tends to drive slightly over the speed limit. It's a cool feature, but I still think it needs a bit more work. 

For example, in an area where there's a speed camera and the speed limit is 30 km/h, my car is going 37 km/h. I believe this is because other cars have previously driven at that speed in the area, influencing the FSD behavior. 

I expect that we'll see an option in a future update where we can adjust the speed limit setting. Currently, we can't override it unless we disable FSD."
1c5i8iw,l0zh4ol,You can indeed override right now. In autopilot menu there‚Äôs a checkbox to disable the auto max feature. Then it will work like you are used to
1c5i8iw,l18u3as,"I don‚Äôt see that feature/checkbox. I do see the checkbox to turn off a ‚ÄòAutomatic set speed offset‚Äô. When that‚Äôs off, it kind of assists with this issue, but then you‚Äôre stuck on one speed that you can manually change BUT it doesn‚Äôt automatically change speeds for you."
1d9ao4s,l7dfk3z,"1:28 - took way too long to turn right

2:40 - again too long to turn right, didn‚Äôt need to stop at the yield sign

Similar to 12.3, deceleration could be smoother‚Ä¶ whenever it starts slowing down there‚Äôs still a huge regen hit followed by barely any regen‚Ä¶ could have spread that out more evenly for smoother deceleration.

Might be more decisive when getting into the double left turn lane at 11:18 than 12.3 would have been.

Overall, hard to spot improvements over 12.3 in this drive apart from no steering wheel nags."
1d9ao4s,l7gze4y,"Agreed. FSD needs a little more confidence in situations where it‚Äôs determined the right hand turn to be safe to make.

Just as a habit, I always keep mine in assertive, but still use the accelerator to ‚Äúencourage it‚Äù to continue the route."
13xvs7b,jmjwk8y,Im updating mine now. I hope it fixes the Apple Music problem cuz I don‚Äôt like using my phone

13xvs7b,jmjjk78,"Keep on your toes at irregular 4-way-stops. I find that even on the most aggressive setting, it‚Äôs overly cautious to where other drivers question what you‚Äôre doing."

13xvs7b,jmk3oa6,It fixed my Apple Music. It was a blank screen for the last 3 days. After update I was prompted to sign in again. Working great now!
13xvs7b,jmk3q9k,Thanks going to check mine now
13xvs7b,jmk5dmi,Mine fixed also. I‚Äôm back happy lol
128yxeu,jelj9dh,Did you have any wait times to charge?
128yxeu,jelfs8s,"If you are doing hotels on a trip like this, hotel charging can be a huge bonus. I did Tucson to San Diego to Orange County to Tucson about a month ago and stayed at hotels with free charging. 

I still spent $75 for Supercharging but I probably saved $50 with hotel charging."
128yxeu,jemclz1,"No, I lucked out at the Biltmore Supercharger in Phoenix. It‚Äôs always busy.  So much so that it caps you at 80%"
128yxeu,jemchms,"I didnt have a choice with the hotels. My work booked them, but I always look for free charging when I‚Äôm booking. You‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs a game changer."
128yxeu,jemeini,Was mostly curious on the highway and once you get into the cities. I live in Phoenix and was gonna take my first trip in the Tesla in a couple weeks.
128yxeu,jemepi4,"I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll have any problems. The car tells you how many open chargers there are too, as you approach"
xwdrza,ir5wwet,"I wouldn't call Tesla a ""Luxury car"" but I would say it is a premium car."
xwdrza,ir6i928,"I know build quality has been iffy in the past, but my 2022 Model 3 P I took delivery of last month (I just hit 1000 miles) is quite good.  I'm certainly not experiencing any rattles, and it's actually pretty quiet until about 80mph.

AC works great, no complaints.  As far as no HUD< I couldn't care less.  Glancing a bit to the right to see my speed is easy.  This and no ventilated seats you knew going in, so I'm unsure what the big deal is.  I'll take the best infotainment in the industry if it means giving up vented seats imo.

Agreed on one pedal driving, it took me a few days to get used to, but it's amazing.  I'll never go back to an ICE car.  Just an fyi, I've heard most owners say that even after 100k miles, the brakes are perfectly fine, which I believe.  I barely touch mine at all.

Anyway, thanks for the post!  Shame yours seems to have issues."
xwdrza,ir6t7k1,"Agree with everything except ‚Äòdriving interface‚Äô. Not that you are wrong about the usefulness of a gauge cluster in front of the the steering, but more like you and everyone that bought a M3 or Y knew about it prior. It was definitely a design choice from Tesla‚Äôs perspective, just like the yoke in the S and X is. Which is another I don‚Äôt get why people complain about having known prior to purchasing. I see it a bit like buying a manual car and then complaining that the transmission is not automatic."
xwdrza,ir64xrr,My paint (MSM) has some orange peel texture on it in places. Maybe it's my older ears but most of the time I'm driving with no music and the road noise seems fine. At least compared to the 2007 Accord it replaced. That's kind of why I leased. Knowing competition was coming hard in the next few years and hoping when it's time to buy they'll be forced to provide more value not being the only game in town. Hopefully by end of 2023 that will be true. Going to buy for sure and keep it for 10-15 years. Just wish the P didn't have that stupid spoiler and red brakes. My SR+ is cool but I'm looking forward to owning a real life electric rocketship.
xwdrza,ir67ewa,"Respectfully speaking, I can only relate to the road noise point you make. All other points are invalid or not a big deal to me.

Perhaps selling your car and go back to ICE luxury car is a good option for you."
xwdrza,ir6ajcc,"Had mine since March 2021, agree with some points here. My negative list:

Blue paint very thin and easy to scratch (my wife's 7 year old blue Corolla paint is better)
Windshield seems softer than others, now I have three tiny rock chips, maybe bad luck?

The steering wheel material seems too easy to damage. Not sure how but mine has two tiny damaged spots I can feel with my fingers. The material is still hanging there, I will try to glue it in place.

I believe the road noise issue might be due to the lack of engine noise that would normally mask it.
Someone done the science and driven around with a decibal meter to compare?

I like the seats (White ones) but I don't live in Texas. Mind you we had a heat wave here in Vancouver BC, no complaints about my car)

I like the minimal interface. A glance over to see the speed is not an issue, same effort to peak thru the steering wheel on other cars.

Overall, you're paying extra for new EV tech, putting the price higher and in the range of more luxurious ICE cars.

If a Model X has the same quality issues that would be ridiculous. No idea if they do."
xwdrza,ir6l3fp,"I recently picked up a 2022 Model 3 at the end of August and agree with a few of your sentiments. For me the build quality is really lacking with choice of materials (ex. plastics and carpet). This is something I knew going in after watching many reviews but still is surprising now that we actually own it. We still own 2 other ices vehicles a 07 Mazda 3 and a 2015 Audi A3. The quality inside is more comparable to my Mazda 3 to be honest. I have already gotten scruffs on a few parts of the car that were barely brushed up against. But besides that everything is pretty good so far. I actually don't think the cabin noise is that bad for me, it's on par with my Audi but definitely above my Mazda 3's internal cabin noise. I'm still on the fence about what the future holds for my next car since  this is technically my wife's car. But I'm definitely leaning towards another Audi at the moment for myself."
xwdrza,ir6lipp,IoniQ 6 looks like a smooth turd
xwdrza,ir6m8o4,"Fair and honest review. I agree with a lot of your points as well on the build - though I have no real complaints as my M3LR is for me ‚Äúthe nicest car I have ever owned‚Äù so my references are all only ‚Äúlesser‚Äù cars. 

I do have a few annoying rattles that piss me off on certain rougher pavements - that even my 2007 Ford Focus doesn‚Äôt rattle on - so that is annoying. 

The overall driving experience for me is sublime though - I can never go back and only hope it gets better from here."
xwdrza,ir6yjnv,"Could try this to reduce cabin noise‚Ä¶

https://youtu.be/XzVMW6Nkmx0

Also rims and tire size and tire itself makes a difference."
xwdrza,ir7svyz,Definitely agree with you had my tesla for a little over a year and I‚Äôm definitely disappointed in build quality. I swear every other week I hear a new rattling noise. This week it‚Äôs coming from my driving side door. I wonder what next week will be!
xwdrza,ir7t8qf,No rattles or squeaks on my m3. Window and tire noise is Normal. I have tested with sound meter. Screen interface is easy and I am not constantly using it to change settings. Voice command work well. Build quality is a bit and miss. Have owned mine for 2+ years.
xwdrza,ir7uiux,"I live in Florida and just picked up my model 3 performance. I agree with the real leather seat option and would have gladly paid more for real leather seats. As far as the instrument cluster, I don't really miss it at all. I do wish there were just a couple of tactile buttons, but probably only because I've owned the car for less than a month and I'm still adjusting to it. I don't have any real complaints about my road noise or A/C, and like I said I live in Florida. It is humid as hell here and is a nightmare in the morning to defrost/fog windows (on every car I've ever owned) so I find it super helpful to precondition my car to solve that issue. I hear horror stories about build quality but mine seems amazing (though I have less than 500 miles on it). There is no raddling, wind noise, or other assortment of things I read online. My father-in-law owns a model Y and some of the plastic pieces inside don't seem nearly as high quality as mine, I wonder if that is a factory thing or maybe because I got a higher trim mine is better? I do fully believe that in 5 to 10 years tesla will have to either make their vehicles cheaper or start to really make the vehicle feel more luxury rather than premium. I'm super excited to see other manufactures catch up to tesla in the next couple of years, but until then I am really enjoying the car and loving the minimalistic vibe of no instrument cluster."
xwdrza,ir64wv7,Couldn't disagree more about the touchscreen. How often are you staring at how fast you're going while driving a normal car? Not often I'd expect. Unless you're booking it all over the place you don't need to constantly be monitoring that.
xwdrza,ir66xao,"You're coming from one of the Boomeriest brands focused on comfort and reliability to an upstart brand pushing the envelope of technology and affordability, so I'm not surprised there's some growing pains there.

Road noise is pretty well known and they continue to add things like laminated windows and ANC. You didn't specify your year/trim, but obviously a 2022 sr+ is quieter than a 2018 P3D.

Ventilated seats. I mean, I'd love those too and wish they offered them in the 3, but they don't and you knew that when you bought the car. Precondition from the app.

A/C - I'm not sure what the complaint it here. 70 seems like 70 to me. Maybe 70 in your Lexus was really 63? If your A/C isn't cooling, have service check it out.

HUD/Cluster - like the seats, you knew this going in. Sounds like you've found a solution that works for you.

Regen - sounds like you've come around on that.

IONIQ 6 looks ridiculous."
xwdrza,ir6aumf,"My build quality was and is fine. Not perfect but fine. 

I like the driving interface and the car has been made substantially better in the time I've owned it. Tell me what other car does free, ongoing , over the internet upgrades. Turn signal video was added. It wasn't good, then they improved it. Now it rocks. 

My A/C is excellent in Florida with window tinting. 

Regen braking is wonderful. Your criticism of one pedal driving told me all I needed to know. You and I are not alike. 

I've had my car for 2 1/2 years. Perfectly reliable with no maintenance costs other than a tire rotation and cabin filter replacement ***done in my driveway***. Not one dealer 2,000, 6,000, 12,000, or any thousand mile fluid change maintenance rip off. 

I'm not a Tesla or a Musk fan boy but I do really like my car.

Do us all a favor and get another car to be disappointed with."
xwdrza,ir77fv2,"‚ÄúI wanted a luxury sedan, instead I bought a tech/sports car: My dissertation. ‚Äù

Any other mind blowing insights for us, O sage?"
xwdrza,ir6ik8t,"The only thing I can relate to is the lack of HUD. I don‚Äôt mind not having a instrument cluster as an EV doesn‚Äôt really need a rpm counter but having a HUD on the windshield with the speed and maybe range would be super helpful, my 2016 Audi had it. I don‚Äôt know how you think the car is loud, my Audi A6 was just as loud if not louder, I think the M3 is fairly quiet. The ES350 is not comparable imo, I think the IS is the comparable Lexus model but Lexus‚Äôs aren‚Äôt built to be performance sedans and the model 3 is. Not a good comparison but If you go and drive a Audi s4 or bmw m340i, the road noise is about the same, interior might be better on these. To me, interior quality is a trade off for driving the most technologically advanced car on the road. The other carmakers WILL catch up and push Tesla to address their shortfalls. Just a matter of when. With all that being said, I still love the car for how it drives which was the main selling point for my purchasing decision."
xwdrza,ir6yxue,"I don't understand your complain about road noise and seats. 

Lexus is built for driving on the cloud feeling. Model 3 has never been intended to do so. It is a small EV with performance of a sport car. Noise level is about the same as BMW M3 or any similar size sport cars, plus Model 3 doesn't have engine noise to cancel out road noise.

Seats. You already know before buying their seats are just seats. They are soft and very comfortable. Why would you put ""seats"" under your build quality complaints? Hot seats in summer have nothing to do with build quality. I have white seats and never have issues with hot summer. You can turn on AC 5 minutes before driving from the app and it will be as cool as a fridge.

Turn on Autopilot and you can gland at your screen safely.


Your opinions about screens are personal, so I have no comment. I find that their single screen works great and no need for more screen."
xwdrza,ir9swvv,"Did you test drive the car before buying it? 

Usually tells you all you need to know

Bit weird to be complaining if it is the same ‚Äúnoise‚Äù in all cars"
xwdrza,ir5x44w,"That's definitely a fair distinction, but at the same time doesn't really change much IMO regarding comparisons."
xwdrza,ir7eism,Same here on my 2022 I just got delivered.  Just over 1k miles and not a single rattle or issues with build quality.  Maybe the older models?
xwdrza,ir6thu3,"Oh I knew about it before buying the car. I just didn‚Äôt know how I would feel about it after getting used to it. Some are fine without it, I just happened to continue not liking having it missing."
xwdrza,ir6g3fp,"You may be able to find a P3D-, which is the performance drivetrain without the performance accoutrement like the spoiler and calipers. That's what I have."
xwdrza,ir67uaw,"Most of the ""negatives"" are unrelated to ICE vs EV."
xwdrza,ir6lbn5,"The road noise in mine is almost exclusively from the tires / wheel well. If I drive on a freshly paved piece of highway at 75 MPH, it's whisper quiet. However, if I move to an older road surface, it can be very loud. The Model 3 needs some sound isolation for the wheels / wheel wells.

I think the issue the OP has with the A/C is probably an issue with the glass roof in a very sunny and hot environment. The roof gets hot and you can feel that it's much warmer in the car near your head under these conditions. If you direct the airflow up, it's much more comfortable (also, precondition by venting and turning the AC on in advance, then close the windows)."
xwdrza,ir7svn1,"I actually like the look of the IoniQ5, and after I read your comment I googled IoniQ6 and holy shit, you are not wrong. I am shook"

xwdrza,ir7jr78,Thanks! Will take a look when I get a chance.
xwdrza,ir9hxj1,I have a rattle in the side door/maybe a blown speaker? Anyone seen that? Would they cover a speaker under warranty

xwdrza,ir6a1m1,"* The first Model S came out in 2012. I would not consider a company that has at least a decade of experience in making and selling consumer available cars an upstart brand IMO. 
* I own the 2022 M3 RWD. Like I said, I don't recall my buddy's Model S at the time having the same cabin noise issues.
* I knew about the ventilated seats, I just didn't know how bad it would be in combination with the vegan leather seats even with tinted windows.
* I actually have a temperature gun coming in to help me figure out if the AC is keeping proper temperature. I definitely will be scheduling an appointment with the SC if needed.
* I knew about the HUD, yes. Like with the seats, knowing and knowing how much it will actually end up affecting you are 2 different things. 
* I definitely did come around to regenerative braking. I did say previously I probably would once I adjusted.

xwdrza,ir6ep9b,Not if the drivetrain of the ICE is $20k of the cost of the vehicle and the drivetrain of the EV is $30k. That $10k has to come from somewhere.

xwdrza,ir6nihx,"My last ‚Äúoff the lot‚Äù car was a 2008 Prius and it was the ‚Äútop tech‚Äù at the time. That car was flawless for me. 

Then for a bit of an interim before my Model 3 I drove two different used (a 2008 then a 2003) Pontiac Vibes - which I loved. 

After I got my Tesla - and the 03‚Äô Vibe stored in my warehouse for a few months - I was smitten with the Model 3. One day I decided to take the Vibe out just to keep the engine lubed‚Ä¶ and was immediately like ‚Äúwhat the hell is this janky mess?!‚Äù hahahaha

1c9l591,l0m7c0s,"Sometimes I feel like my car must be working differently than others' because FSD is still unbelievably bad to the point of me having to disengage just about anytime another car is even close to me because of boneheaded decisions it tries to make and the constant hesitations that make it completely unpredictable to other drivers.

The latest was when it decided to try to pass a line of about 10 cars within about a half mile of the right turn it needed to take. It was literally going to get ahead of maybe 3 of them and try to budge right back into that line of cars I was already in at the last minute to not miss the turn. What. the. Fuck. I can't in good conscience use that shit. Would it get me to my destination? Probably- and that's certainly an achievement for the tech, but until it stops driving like 15 year old asshole, I can only really use it on highways for the auto lane changes.

Does constant shit like this NOT happen to others or are people just more OK with their car acting like that than I am?"
1c9l591,l0m0lsp,"I subscribed to FSD the moment they brought it down to $99. I live in midtown Dallas which I would consider a highly dense area with busy traffic. I have been using FSD daily for my every commute and I must say I have been impressed with the way it has been working and the way it has been making decisions especially during traffic and for lane changes. The only time I had to intervene was during a bike crossing on an interior road. FSD did not recognize the crossing and wasnt stopping for the bikers who were waiting to cross. So I had to intervene and stop the car. I have similar experiences from a friend at a rail road crossing. Apart from this this, I feel it was worth the money!!"
1c9l591,l0nl79i,"Come to Boston.  You'll see FSD hit every single pot hole on the street.

Correction.  I meant your body (mostly your butt) will feel FSD hit every single pot hole."
1c9l591,l0m8g7z,For $100/month I‚Äôm very happy with it.
1c9l591,l0o3puj,"FSD is a terrible, left lane hogging POS. I'm not going to even begin to list all of the times it's fucked up for me, but the most annoying one of all is when it just goes for the left lane and stays there. Every single time. I think out of the hundreds of times I've tried it, I've only had it go back into the right lane once. It will pass a car, and stay in that left lane, forever. I can even hit the turn signal to try and force it back over to the right lane and it won't do it. It just cancels my turn signal and stays in the left lane. This isn't a one off experience either. It does this every single time."
1c9l591,l0o5q31,FSD is useless to me because it requires 2 hands on the steering wheel at all times; might as well drive it myself.
1c9l591,l0oy2gw,"It's insane that people are saying it's coming a long way, using it for the first time this month and it's useless. What was the point of it before?"
1c9l591,l0mp7np,It drives like an 8yo student driver. It‚Äôs got a long way to go. Maybe in 10 years I‚Äôll look at it again.
1c9l591,l0mamdi,I have been trying it on routes with roundabouts and yield on blinking yellow and red and it has handled it really well so far. My trust in it has gone up each time I tried it.
1c9l591,l0onbqx,"I‚Äôve been doing the free trial this month and have noticed too many edge cases to be comfortable. 
1. Currently can‚Äôt (possibly me) set to just active cruise control. Always goes into full self drive mode. However, I came to an intersection without setting a destination; I expected go straight like cruise control; it decided at last second to make a right turn. wtf. Act like active cruise control if no destination is set. 
2. At a T intersection, where we‚Äôre going straight across, decided to get into the short 30 yard passing lane though no one was ahead of us making a turn. 
3. On the NJ turnpike with  navigation on to a service stop with chargers, decided to try to pass cars ahead of us in the exit lane by getting into the left regular traffic lane 
4. Again NJ turnpike (65 limit). 98% of people driving 70-75 including me. 1% driving 60-65, 1% driving 85-90. Autopilot automatically tries to pass the 65 mph drivers. Does not have ability to look behind to make sure a 90 mph entitled ahole isn‚Äôt weaving through traffic like he‚Äôs in a video game 2 seconds behind the car. Need a longer distance rear camera for that situation"
1c9l591,l0z1v6q,"I imagine, regard self-driving, getting the first 80% isn‚Äôt as hard as the last %.  For that, it‚Äôs taking AI and mucho data."
1c9l591,l0mu375,I feel like it doesn‚Äôt think ahead very far. Mine likes to change to the right lane but the can see one block ahead the lane is blocked by parked cars. So it would get stuck in the right lane cus the left lane is jammed with traffic. It would also change lanes when there‚Äôs a bus clearly in the right lane at a bus stop then get stuck behind the bus just try to merge back to the left lane again. It‚Äôs a weird combo of aggressive lane changes and granny driving at stop signs and around pedestrians.
1c9l591,l0muxgc,"I got v12 the other day and in a lot of ways it‚Äôs improved, but in the other hand I was on a rural two lane highway around 10pm last night, a stoplight turned yellow as I was approaching and it hesitated, then just blew through the fully red light. I was ready to brake if needed but there was no one at the intersection. Still, it clearly saw the light changing and failed miserably to stop, which I haven‚Äôt experienced before."
1c9l591,l0me1fi,"Do you have the latest update? (Genuine question)

*Prior* to the latest update, I couldn't go more than 30 seconds without turning it off so I didn't die. With the new update, it's really pretty good. It's not perfect, and I have no plans to buy it, but it's pretty good. This is in a 2023 MYP."
1c9l591,l0pb4i9,What version of FSD are you on?
1c9l591,l0m7kbd,Many posting glowing reviews are Elon lovers and will hype anything he puts out. It is horrible. I laugh at those who paid 8-15 k for it. You are paying to take up the privilege of being a beta tester with all liability.
1c9l591,l0nk0wj,I live in Dallas also and get my first Tesla this week. How does it perform of the freeways?  I take the DNT to the north burbs and back a few days a week in rush hour and really looking forward to FSD those drives.
1c9l591,l0p4r7w,"Lol that is not true IME at all. All I do to keep it from nagging me is use the volume scroll, or a little nudge to the bottom of the wheel. These methods are well documented, and if your car isn't reacting to them, or if it doesn't find them sufficient, there may be an issue with your MY."
1c9l591,l0p58m5,I've driven it to and from work (a commute of 35 minutes one way) and it handled it like a champ. Based on the responses here alone you can easily conclude that to some (a LOT) of us FSD has done a very good job. The most fascinating aspect of some of the responses here is how borderline offended some people get here because they didn't have the same experience I've had with it.
1c9l591,l0nqedl,Umm‚Ä¶ stay safe my dude that‚Äôs sounds deadly
1c9l591,l0meksw,"No, still on v11 here, unfortunately. And yes, I've heard v12 is quite a bit better so looking forward to trying it if it gets pushed to me prior to my monthly billing cycle."
1c9l591,l0mb7we,"When people talk about not having to disengage at all during their commute, all I can think about is how many people they pissed off and all the awkward and dangerous situations it put others in by having to react to its very un-human behavior.

I really do love the car (bought in 2020 before Elon decided to outwardly go completely crazy) and basic autopilot is amazing, but FSD is clearly still in its infancy. I'll, of course, not be re-upping the FSD subscription next month."
1c9l591,l0npw0t,"I use mine in Sachse/Garland/Richardson area and I didn‚Äôt experience any issues yet except lane merges. When 2 lanes merge in small roads with 2 cars side by side, it tries to accelerate unnecessarily."
1c9l591,l0oqv84,I think it will do fine. I use it on 75 everyday and then interior roads on walnut hill to get home. So far it has been impressive. But I would advice you to be attentive all the time especially when it is turning or changing lanes just to be cautious
1c9l591,l0q3qu7,"It really was nothing in this circumstance, but definitely I will be disengaging it if I suspect that it might do that again."
1c9l591,l0met0j,"I would reserve judgement for V12. Surprisingly to me at least, I was able to start the free month trial when I was still on V11. A few days later I got pushed the V12 update.

V11 was horrible - like comically bad - but V12 is pretty decent."
1c9l591,l0n09vv,I would try the latest version and initially test on empty and less busy roads to build confidence into it. Have been using it everyday on my commute and I think it is worth the money.
1c9l591,l0oqx9u,I think I experienced something similar the other. But overall the experience has been great
1c9l591,l0or669,Awesome.  I live on the west side of forest.  I‚Äôm definitely looking forward to the self driving on my commute from frisco to the galleria.
1bvuhc8,ky1z1dd,Average with Auto Speed is more than enough lol. Assertive makes me feel like the car is my bad boy boyfriend my parents would hate but is so slick with the money moves on the highway
1bvuhc8,ky3ishr,Scary.
1btkqq5,kxncbj8,"I'd agree with your comments and add that it ""favors"" the shoulder side of the road vs the center median. In a city like Chicago, where there is a lot of bike traffic and parked cars with door openings happening, it's better to drive slightly closer to the center median than the shoulder.  It is also incredibly laggy at 4 way stops with traffic and obstacles or intersections.   The decision making feels too slow that I'm going to end up rear ended sooner or later..."
1btkqq5,kxnngcq,Did you try FSD on chill mode? Did it soften the experience? I‚Äôll try FSD on chill mode tomorrow
1btkqq5,kxozo0z,"My biggest pet peeve that I think they should (and can fix) is that when a single lane splits into multiples it will take a while to finally pick one of the two and then it does not pick the correct lane based on upcoming turns.  

It should pick the correct lane based on upcoming turns. But it doesn't seem to do that if the turn is past a existing light. i.e. if the turn is 1/4 mile after the light it won't get in the right lane before the light."
1btkqq5,kybsgfy,One thing i made a huge mistake on is let FSD do the driving unless its necessary. I got used to pressing the pedal when it was hesitant and that almost caused an accident. FSD was at a stop sign and other traffic did not have a stop sign. There was a golf cart blocking the view but it seemed like there were no cars and I thought FSD was waiting for the golf cart which gave room for us to turn left while the golf cart was turning right. I didn't see an oncoming car and pressed the accelerator which FSD complied with. It made a hard swere and accelerated to prevent the accident. Trusting FSD from now!
1btkqq5,kxmwhyh,Is there a free trial on fsd?
1btkqq5,kxoknnz,I did. I only tried Chill and Average modes. Did not try Assertive yet.
1btkqq5,kxndcd0,"Yup, I got a 30 day trial on Saturday"
1btkqq5,kxp1mth,I don't feel it changes much except follow distance...
1bhbnf2,kvnrs6p,I depend on the combo of FSD and TACC. FSD is still a total moron about trying to change lanes too early so I still want to have TACC. Why am I forbidden to have both? This Tesla decision was either pure incompetence or shows their disregard for customers‚Äô needs. I‚Äôm just dumbfounded.
1bhbnf2,kvcu3vo,by design.
1bhbnf2,kvd6gq7,I believe they explained that in the update for v12 FSD
1bhbnf2,kvo61a7,I hate FSD 12.3! No TACC!!
1bhbnf2,kvs91fp,"Mostly just wondering why they didn‚Äôt just put TACC on double-pull. Seems like the goal is to make FSD the default, but any option to use TACC would be real nice."
1bhbnf2,kwaerqa,"This update sucks. No regular or even TACC sucks. I‚Äôve been using cruise control since I first started driving in the 90s to set my speed and forget it to avoid going too slow and to avoid speeding. 

If FSD at least went to the speed I set like it used to I could begrudgingly use the single pull option."
1bhbnf2,l0r2dp6,"i am ‚Äúfine‚Äù with FSD (Supervised),‚Äù generally but there are times where i want it to drive and others where i just want cruise control‚Ä¶when FSD is a pain because i can‚Äôt get the speed i want or can‚Äôt get the traffic management i‚Äôm comfortable with, id prefer to just switch to TACC and Autosteer‚Ä¶

So i made the decision to bail on FSD generally until i come across a situation where i think i‚Äôll need it‚Ä¶it now prompts me when i get into the car to turn FSD on‚Ä¶but not if i lose access to the feature(s) i use more regularly - TACC and Autosteer.

So stupid that they changed it but i understand why - they want more training data. Unfortunately, FSD doesn‚Äôt provide the same experience (and still has too many bugs for me to WANT to use it exclusively), so it‚Äôs being turned off and they‚Äôll get less training data from me as a result."
1bhbnf2,kve865e,"If you have double-pull enabled and take over with the steering wheel, on v11 it‚Äôd drop back to Traffic Aware Cruise Control, which was very awkward as it‚Äôd stop displaying the FSD visualizations and use obsolete algorithms for control.  No surprise they‚Äôre getting rid of it."
1bhbnf2,kvkw4ym,I‚Äôm with Yankee on this. I have a 2018 LR RWD M3 and the single pull only in FSD V12 w/ no way to use TACC is a huge disappointment IMO. Would probably not purchase FSD if I knew this would happen. Would prefer enhanced AP w/ TACC instead.
1bhbnf2,ky0nf0y,"here in mid-Michigan the atrocious speed limit values my Y sees makes FSD about as useless as an electric heater on your camel in the Sahara, I am serious it's wrong about 75% of the time, 25 in 55 zones is a biggie! I guess to use TACC I need to disable FSD so be it!"
1bhbnf2,kvdfswx,How about you switch the FSD beta to any of the other 2 options to select the new pull activation then turn back on FSD beta
1bhbnf2,kvdp238,Envious of those who are getting v12. I‚Äôm still on 2023.44.30.8 (FSD 11.4.9) for the past few months. I‚Äôm glad they are making single pull a requirement going forward.
1bhbnf2,kvs8bzn,Design = stupidity?
1bhbnf2,kwup0nn,Where are you seeing this? I didn't see this in the release notes.
1bhbnf2,kvgnfdv,"I absolutely HATE my experience with 12.3 (22 MYP) exactly because of the inability to quickly select TACC.  Full self drive is often horrible to the point of not wanting to engage in many situations where TACC is better and we all know that using the pedal can be a herky-jerky experience.  Unfortunately, we don't have the option to make a choice with restricted single-pull FSD.  To switch to basic Autopilot now requires stopping, put in park, then select - and of course you can't go back to fsd again.  And as far as safety goes: I was driving along a well marked country highway yesterday with the car wandering all over the lane like a drunk with a car behind me. (Clear mid-day and well-marked roadway).  Holding the wheel to release the FSD (and stay within the lane) dropped FSD and went immediately into regen braking, resulting in a one finger salute from the guy who then passed me after nearly rear-ending me.  Additionally, the car started ignoring speed offset inputs and wouldn't even maintain posted speed.  In a 50mph area, the car locked in at 46 even after gradually adjusting the scrollwheel up to 70.  I Reset the system and this seems better now, but WTF!  I wish we had the ability to recover previous versions... 11 was never perfect, but for me much better than 12.  I hope at a minimum we'll have the option to select single vs double pull on the stalk."
1bhbnf2,kwupgtc,Wym very awkward it's actually very intuitive.¬† Steer when you want let the car do it when you don't. The only thing that changes is the blue visualization of the cars planned path which makes sense since its no longer steering. The lights/cars and all other object detection still worked.¬†
1bhbnf2,kvdfx9a,Tried that. Moved back to single pull and greyed out. Was told single pull will be required in FSD
1bhbnf2,kvxnv0l,"Don‚Äôt be. I promise. It just introduces new problems from 11.4.9. Some things are better, but the bad things outweigh the good in my opinion.¬†"
1bhbnf2,kwuqb04,"I'd roll it back in an instant. It gets slightly more aggressive moving around stopped traffic but now refuses to do more than 5mph over the limit regardless of where you set the max even if there is no other cars. Before unless there was obstacles or something like a blind curve it would pretty reliably sit at the ""max"" limit. Now I have to hold the pedal the whole time.¬†"
1bhbnf2,kvszspm,screwing with TACC is certainly not smart for sure.
1bhbnf2,kvgqr78,"I just keep my foot over the gas before I take over, or even depress it a bit.


But yeah having access to TACC would be nice."
1bhbnf2,kwuwgd3,"The old TACC also used very, very different speed control algorithms.  It doesn‚Äôt support the new ‚Äúauto‚Äù speed control which is driven by the neural net you just turned off.  It would do very badly on some city streets which was jarring as you‚Äôre driving along, take control with the wheel, and TACC freaks out in a situation that FSD was comfortable with.  It also would completely switch visualization modes which was confusing (and honestly, personally, I thought something was broken until I figured out why it did this). 

A bunch of reasons why this was terrible UX. 

I mean, I agree that it‚Äôd be nice to have a modern TACC, but given they‚Äôre completely focused on making FSD work well, I understand why the double-pull has been disabled."
1bhbnf2,kvy10t0,Too late. I got updated to v12.3 yesterday lol. It‚Äôs working than ever in my common drive I take to my child‚Äôs school. Zero interventions needed vs before I needed to do at least four.
1bhbnf2,kvh5i7f,"Yes, it's easy enough to avoid the regen situation, but a PITA otherwise for those wonderful times when Nav wants you to exit somewhere you rather wouldn't, or when the T decides to move right to incorrectly put you in the onramp merge lane or decides to signal and pass an unbroken line of cars getting ready for your exit.  Yes, I can drive without TACC if needed, but my point is that TACC is a valuable selection that on many drives is much more suitable than flaky FSD.  My wonderful Tesla now has poorer quality CC than my 23 Santa Fe.  Add to that the phone connection issues and all the other bugs and I definitely am not one of the fan-boys claiming how good the tech is.  FSD used to be the most amazing and frustrating thing about the car and has now downgraded to still fairly amazing but really f'n annoying."
1bhbnf2,kwwdkz4,The new speed algorithm is absolute trash. V11 would happily sit at whatever you set the max if there was no obstacles and good visibility.¬† Now it barely wants to do the speed limit with zero obstacles and half a mile of visibility. I never had it where it drove under the speed limit for extended periods of time until now. I basically have to hold the accelerator the whole time. It never had an issue handing off before and if it can still do tacc with autosteer there is no reason they can't just use that. Or keep the neural net going but just don't make it steer. Surely there is a better middle ground than just getting rid of it. If they want to disable it with the auto speed that's fine. If the new FSD wasn't TACC compatible it shouldn't have been launched. I dont get removing something that worked okay for something that works worse (even when not accounting for the loss off TACC). The new FSD is not good enough to give up CC yet. Wish we had the option to roll back updates bc now I have to revert to basic autosteer just so I don't lose CC when the car does something dumb.¬†
1buvpqw,kxvcm65,the acceleration and braking is the worst part. Very jerky and unnatural. I start to get carsick after a while. Even worse for passengers. I would not use FSD right now.
1buvpqw,kxw7ogx,"my autopilot would ""lean"" away from trucks before"
1buvpqw,kxy5jui,As if tesla drivers doesn‚Äôt get enough bad rep before. Now everyone is driving erratically on the road testing out FSD.
1buvpqw,kxvq0jx,Yes! It‚Äôs quite the leadfoot.

1bqvqgv,kxgzoea,"It‚Äôs so funny. I had my first experience with it, and it felt like having a 15-year-old driver. It‚Äôs a very cool technical demo but I feel like they have a long way to go to achieve their initial goal‚Ä¶ like at least five more years until they can even argue it‚Äôs lvl 4 or 5. 

A few notable things:
- The perception is really good. It seems to truly see everything around it.
- it seems to have no sense of ‚Äúdriving language‚Äù inching forward on a right on red, making all other drivers nervous. There was also a zipping situation where the car refused to let someone in.
- sometimes it just like splitting lanes for no reason without moving over into a single lane
- The speed is all over the place. Sometimes it drives really quickly and sometimes it drives like my grandma who should have their license revoked.
- it also stopped in a left turn lane with no stop sign and no traffic which actually is how I failed my DMV drivers exam

Overall cool peek of the future but a long long way to go to full autonomy."
1bqvqgv,kxpi39h,The mixed reviews are so weird. Took me 50 minutes across rush hour Las Vegas with zero intervention. It was seriously impressive compared to previous versions.
1bqvqgv,kxjns7x,"I have to highly disagree. I have a 20 minute commute and had the 3 month trial last year. It is cool on highways in other easy scenarios.

The new update is better, but after trying it for just two days I had at least two dozen times I had to take over.

There is no way I would pay for this in its current state unless I was doing a LOT of highway driving."
1bqvqgv,kxjscau,Failed the wife test within 30 seconds after turning it on when it automatically started slowing down to a crawl when we were the only ones on the road. And I agree with her. What the fuck? And they‚Äôre releasing it to the masses now?
1bqvqgv,kxsx4yk,"yep my experience too, the slow speed needs to get fixed then it's great"
1bqvqgv,kxkdbvp,"He moved it from ‚Äúbeta‚Äù to ‚Äúsupervised,‚Äù and I feel like maybe it‚Äôs finally a beta. In the two days I used it so far, it failed to slow down in a signaled school zone, turned left while navigation was telling it to turn right, failed to slow down for a speed bump, just started driving on its own in no particular direction after a trip completed, ran over a curb, missed a turn and slowed down like it was lost, and a few other minor things. It‚Äôs simply not ready in any way for widespread release."
1bqvqgv,ky8vl9u,"I have a 2021 MYLR.  As of today, 4/5, I don't have any sign that the FSD supervised trial is available to me.  Is this being applied to our cars in a phased manner, and should I just be patient?  Or is there something else that I should/could be doing to ensure that I get the trial soon?"
1bqvqgv,kydqrtm,What defines an eligible vehicle for fsd (supv)? I have a 2023 M3 and have done the single month subscription twice (1 year apart) for comparison purposes. Didn't want to pay $200 and get v11. How to know what you'll get?
1bqvqgv,kyidt23,"Ah, I have to stop updating my software. Got it. Thanks"
1bqvqgv,kxivh68,"I engaged FSD after setting navigation up and pulling out from the parking space to the right lane. It immediately initiated a hard left maneuver! I don‚Äôt know if it was going to be a lane change, or a left or u turn. I took control, drove a block, and re-engaged. After that it was fine. It drove well enough that people probably couldn‚Äôt tell whether I was a robot or just an overly cautious senior with a lead foot. Inside, I knew it could do anything at any time, and I‚Äôd better be ready."
1bqvqgv,kxh4co2,"Further, my experience is also that it waits way to long to get in the proper lane to make a turn, it‚Äôs gotten into turn only lanes when I‚Äôm not turning, it will merge a lane out of the lane it needs to be in only to immediately merge back into that lane, and generally drives in a way to annoy other drivers around me, I‚Äôve also had it freak out in left handed turns and take forever to make the turn. I‚Äôm talking 15+ seconds to make a turn with no other traffic around.

The demo has pretty much just shown me I‚Äôm not missing out on anything by not having it and it still has a long way to go."
1bqvqgv,kxoyxgy,"Same experience. It is overly tentative at times and hits the accelerator too hard in others . It also has terrible lane selection. Personally I believe the free trial is to get as many different inputs from drivers as possible, so the system doesn‚Äôt only work for Chuck Cook"
1bqvqgv,kxjpuxp,"I'm sorry to hear. The highway driving as far as I know is mostly the same as V11. In what situations did you need to take over? On my first day with V12 I thought it was going to drive right into a curb divider or too close for comfort and the second I tried it ready to take over last second and it around it fine and has been so far. There's been two times I need to push accelerator at a recently turned green stop light intersection, car drives and then stops and starts edging forward."
1bqvqgv,kxjuqbn,I agree there's some weird shit with breaking in the middle of no where but I usually tap the accelerator and its all good. I'm usually laser focused on the road and car while FSD is on so I rarely ever have a problem.  It's not a finished product despite the rumor the beta tag is being removed soon. Still I can keep FSD on consistently from point to point and only need to park the car when I reach my destination and need to tap pedal at one or two stop lights.
1bqvqgv,kxoowf7,[deleted]
1bqvqgv,kxkftfo,that's not good do you have HW4 car or something? I haven't seen anything like that in about 5 days of playing around with it. I see it slow down unnecessarily and slow to use right of way at stop signs. I haven't seen it miss a turn or do anything dangerous.
1bqvqgv,ky8w4tt,I'm sorry to say I wouldn't know. I bought FSD back in 2019. Maybe search the Tesla App? Hopefully it's in the inbox or promotional section.
1bqvqgv,ky8x7lu,"Additional info, I am on 2024.8.7"
1bqvqgv,kyi5bj2,"https://preview.redd.it/ydpz1efwn3tc1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98d8373e3d3fbc41729a83e25ca95ef1e8b6d650

Looks like you might need to wait for Tesla to update your firmware if your current software is too new."
1bqvqgv,kxp93kh,"Same for me. I've only used it with this trial period, but the people who have been acting like it's perfectly usable are crazy. In 1 short drive to the hardware store I had it try to make a right turn in front of a speeding oncoming car, pull into a turning lane and then veer out of it almost causing a collision twice, slam on the brakes mid intersection of a yellow light, and try to go straight from a right turn only lane (though that might have been a poor mapping issue?). It does a lot of things impressively, but I would never pay for it unless it got significantly better. Highway driving seems pretty problem free and it is nice in those scenarios, but literally anything else I don't trust it near enough."
1bqvqgv,kxjqdvx,"Tons of things. From speeding at the back of slowing vehicles (only sometimes) to lane changes when there was no room, forcing itself into the passing lane when in center and no one in front of me, driving through debris and hitting potholes, failing to merge onto a highway, STOPPING on an off ramp, speeding through school zones, going super slow for no reason, and a lot more I am forgetting.

It's improving and one day I believe it will get there. But it's still very bad. I would never tell someone else to buy it. And the price is insane unless you drive a lot to justify it."
1bqvqgv,kxsaiku,"I have a trip that's a lot of county/state highways (two lane and unmarked 1-2 lane roads.)

Half the time it thought the speed limit was 25mph (mapping issue I'm sure)  I could accelerate it up to the speed I set but it slowly crept back down.

After a stop sign, it would accelerate up to the assumed road speed and not go higher until I forced it over.

It does NOT handle hilly roads.  It would slow down coming up to the crest of the hills every time.  I had to push the accelerator 90% of the time I was using it because it simply would not just drive.

It would not go the speed limit I set.  It seemed to go up to the limit it thought was the speed limit on the road (nobody goes the speed limit) and stop accelerating, I had to manually push the pedal to get it to go faster.

It brakes WAY too early at stop signs.

Divided highways?  Perfect (IMO).  Off the highway?  Oh lord.

I have a weird quirk where my wipers now wipe on a clear sunny day once after engaging (about 20 seconds after I engage).

**I cannot single tap to just put the car in cruise anymore.  That's the killer for me**.  I want to just set the cruise sometimes and not deal with auto-drive.  I have to stop the car, set it back to the ""v11"" auto drive and continue on if I want my cruise control."
1bqvqgv,kxsb1rg,I have mine in assertive and it acts the same way... too timid.  It also doesn't go the max speed I set.
1bqvqgv,kxl9bxw,HW3. It hasn‚Äôt done anything particularly dangerous so far. My interventions have been to avoid breaking the law or for comfort or because it went the wrong way.
1bqvqgv,ky0imfu,"> ""Half the time it thought the speed limit was 25mph (mapping issue I'm sure)""

Same experience, that and doing 40mph past a rte 225 sign and it slows to 25, consistently. Oh, and the 40mph road which is 25mph going in the other direction.

Speed limit mapping/reading seems to be a HUGE problem around where I live North of Boston. 90% of my interventions on 12.3.3 are caused by wrong speed limit.

I'd be very willing to make corrections to the database if I knew where the data could be accessed."

xyh3dx,iriijka,"It‚Äôs more aggressive than I like to drive too! I would like to see FSD‚Äôs safety score! I my particular case I think the main issue is the speed limits near my house are at least 10mph too high. It‚Äôs an urban business district with no bike lanes or space between the sidewalks and road. With FSD engaged the car drives like it thinks we‚Äôve just robbed a liquor store. In areas where the roads are better designed it does great. A little jerky at times, but it makes reasonable decisions. All in all, it‚Äôs impressive!"
xyh3dx,irky4q9,Lane selection is the single biggest problem I am seeing in my daily usage. Almost all my disengagements are due to incorrect lane selection.
xyh3dx,irjmtxd,"I'm surprised at how early it wants to get in an incorrect turn lane by me as well. The rest of the time it won't get in turn lanes until the white dashes show up, which around here is always too late. It's missed turn lanes for backed up traffic a lot, which I have always taken oven and sent feedback in on."
xyh3dx,irm0p8z,You can go to openstreetmaps and fix the speed limits if they are way higher than what is provided by the city. You can also scroll the wheel down below the speed limit however a bit tedious sometimes.
banmbg,ekcvzn2,"IDK if it needs to be that complex. But I would like to be able to upvote/downvote NoA lane changes. Especially when it indicates a lane change right when I would have done the same, it should be given positive reinforcement."
banmbg,ekcy8vk,You already provide feedback by disengaging or manually making a maneuver. No need for it to be a survey kind of thing. 
banmbg,ekcv35c,"""Don't hit stuff""

""Don't do stupid crap!""

""Wake up screen, why are you restarting?"""
banmbg,ekcw7nl,You can still manually initiate lane changes while in NOA. We did it yesterday to move from behind a construction vehicle (even though it was going the speed limit). I would hope Tesla would use that information for training data.
banmbg,ekejgww,"Not an owner, but from what I've read, ""cancel"" commands would probably be amazing."
banmbg,ekfn1bt,"would be great to not constantly have to cancel speed based lane changes because someone is driving 1 mph slower than me while my car is set to MILD. 

""Flow with traffic"" > Station keeping mode."
banmbg,ekcw8vx,"I hope other people can‚Äôt train my car actually, unless they are professional drivers or something "
banmbg,ekd0dbf,no training goes on while you're driving.   
banmbg,ekdf9pg,"I'd like to (after cancelling an auto lane change) be able to disable auto lane changes for a specific number of miles. With the flooding recently, I take a detour every day that goes down to one lane on the interstate for 7 miles. There are big cones every several feet to keep you from going into the right lane. NoA contininually tries to merge over there though. "
banmbg,eke1rl5,"How the car would distinguish if you send a real command or you are simply talking with someone in the car or on the phone ?  
I'm not sure how the S and the X models work for the voice, but on the M3, we have to press an icon on the screen to initiate the talking. Then is it much faster to use the left stalk to do the lane changing ?"
banmbg,ekcwge3,"Agree with you. I‚Äôve been able to prompt it by using the turn signals at my timing rather than when it thinks it should (sometimes early, sometimes late). Doing so must have some training value for Tesla‚Äôs NN. Doesn‚Äôt NN training depend on interventions and positive reinforcement?"
banmbg,ekdbssw,We asked 100 people: name something you might say as a passenger in a car being driven by a blind person.
banmbg,ekfnn50,tapping the flashing blue card at the top of the screen works pretty fast and easy enough but Tesla just needs to continue refining the experience to make it work better with more cars on the road.
banmbg,ekcwq3v,"The training would probably be designed to regress to the mean‚Äîwhat average drivers would do. Average is probably what‚Äôs considered normal and safe. Right now, it does things that aren‚Äôt even normal, such as the way too passive lane changes. It only yields, does not assert."
banmbg,ekcxwg8,"Not really. The current NN in your car is read-only, it doesn't learn anything. The way it's been explained is that Tesla will periodically conduct data collection ""campaigns"" where they request specific information from the car. If they are conducting a campaign on NoA, it may get some information from when you cancel NoA-initiated lane changes, and they can use that for a future revision of the NN. They're unlikely to get any info from driver-initiated lane changes because there are too many random reasons for a human driver to do so."
banmbg,ekcwwi1,Yeah maybe it could even differentiate between more passive and more aggressive driving and let folks have a preference.
banmbg,ekcy39h,"Don‚Äôt want to be that pedantic guy, but I feel like the term assertive driving behavior is qualitatively different from aggressive driving behavior, and optimizing for assertiveness would be great for NOA all around."
662kqm,dgf35aq,"I'm still not sure if these requirements make it interesting for any other car manufacturer to use those patents...

> A party is ""acting in good faith"" for so long as such party and its related or affiliated companies have not:

> *    asserted, helped others assert or had a financial stake in any assertion of (i) any patent or other intellectual property right against Tesla or (ii) any patent right against a third party for its use of technologies relating to electric vehicles or related equipment;

"
662kqm,dgf68l3,"Remember they open sourced this patent 6 years after they got them/where using them. 

They did so to leave no excuse to other auto manufacturer that they cannot scale make a great electric vehicle.

Granted not all things tesla does are patented and some are secure by obscurity.
"
662kqm,dgf53t4,Idk the exact details but I thought those companies that use Tesla patents have to open theirs as well.. 
662kqm,dgfgobk,"The average car buyer would have no idea if the car they buy from another manufacturer is using a Tesla patent or not. It's not like they have to put a Tesla logo on the side of their cars or anything. How does not using a free patent hurt their brand at all? It's just free engineering know-how. Who wouldn't want that? I don't see any downside at all, from benefiting from someone else's intellectual property that has been freely gifted to you. As far as I know the only requirement is to not make or sell ICE vehicles. Is there some other requirement I'm missing?

I guess looking below at the post by Vik1ng, you might be paranoid that if you build a vehicle around some Tesla patents but then 5 years later Tesla tries to patent something that you pioneered on your own vehicles, now you can't challenge Tesla's bogus patent attempt because doing so invalidates your own use of Tesla patents for the past 5 years of vehicles.

On the other hand, is it really a problem as long as Tesla keeps open-sourcing everything? In other words if Tesla is letting you use their own patents to get a leg up in the EV market then maybe it's fair that you have some skin in the patent game too?"
662kqm,dgf22n8,"I think most of tesla's patents are around the battery design and more in-car designs, but it's not just that other car companies are going to lose competitive advantage, it's also that they are going to be promoting tesla in a sense who might be a competitor as customers that trust a brand who trusts another brand (by using their patents) will suggest that the customers should trust that brand too and so buy cars from tesla."
662kqm,dgg5izu,"I was listening to NPR and the episode of the podcast I was listening to was about Tesla which is why I came to this subreddit. [Here](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/07/09/329895088/episode-551-the-case-against-patents) is a link to it if you are interested. This is the [paper](https://research.stlouisfed.org/wp/2012/2012-035.pdf) that they mention in the podcast if you want it to read.

The arguments against patents were summed up in the paper as:

* Stop the growth of things and ideas that are being patented

* Competition fosters growth in productivity

* Patents encumber free trade 

* Different sectors work differently so having one system for all industries is very ineffective

It is beneficial for Tesla Motors to eliminate patents because it sets their system as the standard. With competitors there will be more growth in the electrical car market which will help Tesla in the long run. "
662kqm,dgf1ty1,"the patents have been built around the tesla cars, to be used for the tesla with it's unique design, however, other car companies might have a different kind of design, figuring out how to use the patents with current design  might be challenging and if a similar car design to that of a tesla was used it would lead to other companies losing their unique selling point/competitive advantage, unless if the patents are easy to apply to different designs to keep other companies' competitive advantage. "
662kqm,dgf3lph,"In terms of challenge, I think the open source strategy is a good way to challenge other companies, it's like saying ""here is a great patent. See how you can make it greater!"""
662kqm,dgwlpvy,"It's just the media that might make a big discussion out of it, as you know they are also looking for thinks to interest people, cars that use the patents are likely to be on the news which would generate a lot of word of mouth about it."
b0pzq5,eigaexb,"Good feedback, thanks!"
b0pzq5,eigbl4q,"HOV guidance is still an issue. It still aggressively tries to get into the HOV lane even up to just 1 mile from my exit. About 0.5 miles away it switches to try and get to the right to get me to my exit, but of course it can't switch 5 lanes in 0.5 miles."
b0pzq5,eigefa1,"I don't know. For me, some parts of 2019.5.15 NoA seem better but others seem worse. There were areas that the car hugged the outside on curves and those are fixed... but now it veers toward the lines in other areas. On an open stretch of freeway I was doing 75, changed it to 80 and the car kept going 75 exactly...

Unrelated to NoA, I've also noticed some lagginess. Today when in reverse, the camera image froze for a second. That's never happened before. The fold mirrors feature is cool... but it doesn't unfold the mirrors in the same location in reverse. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  
"
b0pzq5,eigiwdv,"- Moving over to ""merge"" into onramp lanes even when no cars are around is much better. It generally follows the left line now instead of centering itself.

- There's a few areas where it erroneously wanted me to move to the left lane to follow the route, even though the right lane doesn't end. Those went away now.

- I had some nasty phantom braking approaching an overhead sign where I've have had phantom braking before. Normally I can push the accelerator for a couple seconds and let off and it resumes, this time it took about 1/4 mile before it corrected itself.

- I've had a few more aborted lane changes than normal. Normal is once a week, I've had 2 or 3 this week. These are phantom ones where the lines are clearly visible and no cars are around.

Overall I've found it much more refined, but still a bit buggy. I'd be happy with it and unconfirmed lane changes at this point."
b0pzq5,eigekll,"Agree with your impressions. I felt also that merging into, and letting others merge is very very smooth. Super happy with this."
b0pzq5,eigqvbn,"I still get tons of route-based lane changes that are totally pointless. Simply the car cannot see all the lanes at once (i.e. if there is a fork/barrier separating them), so it localizes itself into the wrong lane, and everything gets offset from where it should be."
b0pzq5,eigdwt4,"I did a 2019.5.15 test today that included 3 exits. The car handled the whole drive flawlessly. It could have worked perfectly without confirmation. 

However...the one big thing is that this car needs rear radar to make better informed lane changes. The fisheye backup camera can't see cars approaching from behind with 10-20mph of overtake and will try to cut them off every time. This seems like a hardware issue that would be hard to solve. "
b0pzq5,eigbt5h,Anyone know how NoA deals with merging from a fast carpool lane to nearly standstill traffic? 
b0pzq5,eightfe,Good write up! I also noticed similar improvements but haven't had much time to really give it a good test. Also unfortunately the lane markings on my exit to go home so it always fails there including with this new update. But really I can't blame it since the lines are completely gone from the winter and just generally shitty roads in Chicago. 
b0pzq5,eiijxi5,"Thanks for sharing your impressions.  I haven't used NoA on 5.15, but I have noticed some normal AP improvement.  Specifically, my commute requires a couple of highway lane merges (where two separate segments of the same highway recombine, so instead of 2+2 lanes you have 3 contiguous lanes).  AP now anticipates the merge and seems to match speed to the car in the other merging lane so everyone ends up with space.  At first, I was surprised that the car decelerated, then I realized it was planning ahead to maintain the same follow distance behind the other car.  Previously it would have sped right into the merge and either a) freaked out or b) merged and then decelerated sharply to reestablish the desired follow distance, the same as if a car cut in front of me.  This behavior is much more natural and gives me hope!"
b0pzq5,eigaj6w,"- When my Navigate on Autopilot is taking an exit, I did not see the speed limit setting adjust down as it did before.  
- Resuming Autopilot when in traffic seems to be *slightly* more abrupt

From: 2018.50.6  
To: 2019.5.15"
b0pzq5,eigiv7l,I like NOA. People have given mixed feedback but net net for me it is better to use it than not. 
b0pzq5,eigynsc,"Does it use the blinker to merge from the on ramp yet? To me that seems like a pretty big gap in the existing functionality.  When taking an exchange, it will exit, but then when it comes to merging onto the next road it just kind of follows the lines as it merges and it doesn't seem to be making a lane change in it's mind. There's no turn signal, and I haven't observed it trying to yield.  In my mind the software should be using something like the lane change routine there to position it's self or yield as needed, and at the very least it should put on the blinker so it's legal.

(My experience is from 2018.50.6)"
b0pzq5,eih6asi,"Tried it yesterday, it still wanted me to get in the right lane for an exit 7 miles away, when I was doing much better in the middle lanes. Tapping to delay only shut it up for 1 mile."
b0pzq5,eiidphc,"Great write up, and as a Boston native this gives great insight into the progress that NoA is making (I‚Äôm still on 2018.50.6). Since you recently went on a long road trip I have a couple questions. So, I‚Äôm planning on driving to Florida in a couple months which will be about 3000 miles round trip. Since your road trip is pretty close to mine distance-wise, I‚Äôm interested to hear how helpful you found autopilot to be on your road trip? 

It helps me a ton on my commute, but I‚Äôm curious about how much of a difference it made when using it for an extremely long drive like the one I‚Äôm planning and which you‚Äôve already taken. Also, how did you find supercharging to be? I‚Äôm hoping that when I take my trip v3 superchargers will have been rolled out on the east coast, but I‚Äôm still interested in hearing about your experience using the v2 superchargers."
b0pzq5,eigw3f6,Turn off ‚Äúuse HOV lanes‚Äù in settings 
b0pzq5,eigdmyk,"That's weird.  Today on my drive to work, it wanted to exit the HOV lane about 3-4 miles away."
b0pzq5,eigwdly,Do you have it set to mad max?
b0pzq5,eihbabc,i disabled use hov lanes because of this
b0pzq5,eiijkvn,If your on madmax get off. NOA didn't work for me at all until I was off madmax. Less mistakes
b0pzq5,eigi0cv,"Yeah, the fold mirrors feature isn't quite all there.  I park in a narrow garage, so it's neatoh that they fold in when I enter the garage so I won't clip them on the side ... but getting out, I kinda need those mirrors, so have to manually unfold them ... and in reverse would need to avoid the side.  Sorta makes half-sense in my use-case."
b0pzq5,eigml9r,There is no way I want unconfirmed lane changes as long as it is still suggesting incorrect changes or aborting lane changes. I need to check again since I got the update yesterday but one spot it would tell me I need to get in the middle lane to follow route even though I actually need to get over into the upcoming on/off ramp far right lane just a couple hundred yards ahead. 
b0pzq5,eighe0u,"The car uses the side repeater cameras, not the backup camera, for this."
b0pzq5,eighnj2,"I agree.  Needed, but shouldn't be that hard to solve -- just because there's a fisheye lens in the rear doesn't mean it can't see stuff.  A friend has a drone with a fisheye but with software to adjust so you can zoom in a great deal and still get remarkable clarity.  The optics should be sufficient already, but it would take some work, I guess."
b0pzq5,eighrx3,"No, they're all dead :-)  In its current incarnation, I would not be willing to test this.  Still seems like a work in progress."
b0pzq5,eigbon4,"Unfortunately it still handles carpool lanes terribly. If you have carpool lanes enabled, it will try to keep/put you there as long as possible, even within a mile of the exit. If I exit the carpool lane a few miles before my exit, it will try to put me back in repeatedly until it's within a mile of the exit, at which point it frantically tries to move me toward the exit. They need some smarter logic there"
b0pzq5,eij3vyg,"I did a repeat test today and was able to see speed limit adjustment, not just at interchanges but on normal speed changes. Not sure what the algorithm is, though. I was set to 10 over in 65 mph zone, and it went into a slow curve where speed was 50, then 45 and it slowed down to 65, then 60. When limit increased back to 65 it went to 5 over.  But it definitely adjusted. "
b0pzq5,eihcrxf,"Don't know but will test tomorrow.  Yes, this is an essential feature.  My experience, plus a number of other comments suggest that the improvements to NoA in this release were largely just incremental refinements of existing functionality (except for the ""Tap to Delay"" bit)."
b0pzq5,eij47ng,"In the middle of my retest and after 3 interchanges no indication of automatic blinker use. In fact, it failed to even recognize a well-marked exit and I had to take over. This is either new (bad) or its because the merge area of the exit was marked with many short dashes. Dunno. "
b0pzq5,eiiipha,"My family lives in Maine, about 5 hour drive. In the past I would arrive tired, wired, and uncomfortable. With AP, excellent seats, great sound, good hvac, and especially a very quiet ride, the drive is a delight. 

The long trip was a blast for the same reason. I mostly drive during the daytime, and sought scenic (and curvey!) roads. It sounds like a rationalization but the stops for charging were also restful -- most had some kind of place to eat or get coffee.  The nav is awesome and having supercharger integrated into mapping was very helpful. 

The supercharger network is really well layed out and I never had to make compromises of my route just to charge. I tended to charge from 10% to around 70% -- maybe a little more on either end, and with a warm battery charging was usually done before I finished my meal or whatever -- charging is fastest in this range, so rather than go for a full charge I might have charged twice in a day. 

I would not assume that v3 chargers will suddenly replace v2. Obviously faster is better in general, but v2 is really quick, and if you're taking a drive, why not relax and let the sights and wonderful people you'll meet make for a more chill and engaging experience. And like I said, I never felt like I was waiting for charging to be done. 

To me, this car is perfect for long, multi day trips.

Enjoy!! "
b0pzq5,eigwbxy,"I mean, I do use the ""use HOV"" setting because I need it to beat traffic. I just have to disengage NoA when I get near my interchange exit so it doesn't pester me about going back into the carpool lane. This should be interesting when No-Confirm NoA comes out, hopefully they improve the lane guidance logic"
b0pzq5,eige1wd,"For me it does that on some freeways, and on other freeways it tries to leave the HOV lane 0.5 miles away."
b0pzq5,eigfwct,Haven‚Äôt tried the latest version yet but have the same issue where it wants me to start merging like 3-5 miles before my exit. 
b0pzq5,eigwg72,"Yes, but I've tried ""Average"" too and it exhibits the same behavior."
b0pzq5,eiijq32,"Do you use Average? I switched between the two and I still had issues with HOV. It would aggressively try to get me to HOV 1 mile away even on an empty freeway. But maybe it got better in a recent update? I'll definitely give it another shot again, thanks!"
b0pzq5,eij34u7,"I have recently realized that a lot of my frustrations are due to mad max -- it is super sensitive and makes a lot more decisions to change ... and in it's current state, these are often bad or badly timed decisions. Average is much better for me, I think. 

I really wish they could speed up the lane changing -- so many times it seems to think, and think, and think at which point there's a car where it wants to go ... and yet it still suggests the lane change. This is far more dangerous than a crisper and more decisive action, and would communicate intent to other drivers much better.

Also, with lane changes when there's a car to the right that you have just passed, even if you're well ahead of the passed car, and still moving faster, the system seems unwilling to accelerate a bit to match speed and find an opening, and instead decides to brake (thereby ""unpassing""!). Stupid and confusing for all parties. 

This will all get worked out, I'm sure. "
b0pzq5,eigjgwy,"Same... it should just work like the garage door (or opposite). The garage door opens, mirrors close. Garage door closes, mirrors open. Seems simple enough."
b0pzq5,eij3eet,This extremely annoying behavior seems somewhat better in the new version ... I think. Fingers crossed as that was a major reason I stopped using NoA in 2018.50.6
b0pzq5,eigixk8,Fair enough. If that's the case maybe there is hope. 
b0pzq5,eigiwcn,I suppose if they are taking a crop view that zooms in...then maybe. I just know that when I look at the backup camera cars that are right on my tail still look super far away.
b0pzq5,eiha47j,"Or they could create two options, use HOV for nav and auto merge into HOV lanes "
b0pzq5,eigpgpf,"Digital image manipulation is pretty standard stuff -- this is how the drone I mentioned did it -- as long as the optics are ok, and as long as the image sensor is sufficient there should be plenty of pixels.  Just speculating..."
13qt0qc,jlgjk8g,"This makes sense because pushing the right scroll wheel left/right changes the AP behavior.

Doesn't the legacy AP stalk have like 5-6 ""spots"" on it?  Does it use the first three, or how does that work?  Just a bunch of empty ""stops""?"

A car is not an ""investment""

>Given Tesla's assertion of their vehicles lasting 300,000-500,000 miles on a battery

They can ""assert"" whatever they want, but once the battery is out of warranty youre on your own."
17uekud,k936wq2,"Not a smart idea. I have a 13 Model S P85. Everything was smooth and dandy until car it about 95k malls. Suspension issues, MCU issues, drive train needed to be replaced, etc... Only a matter of time before battery dies. I luckily am picking up my new MYLR tomorrow and transferring my free supercharging from my S to the Y. I could only imagine how many more things will go wrong if I try to keep the S alive in 2024...

That being said I had NO maintenance issues for 9 years. It this past year and hitting 100k miles that things started going south....

TLDR: I would not buy that old of a Tesla as your 15-16k investment will double over the next few years out of warranty. So take the 30k and go elsewhere or buy a new 3 or Y."
17uekud,k93cx3t,"I love my old S. I think it was a great purchase. But you have to be ready for potentially thousands in repairs. This far I've been able to handle them. Most people looking for a car in that price range aren't ready for those kinds of repairs. So if you are them great, go for it!"
17uekud,k937gsz,"> Given Tesla's assertion of their vehicles lasting 300,000-500,000 miles on a battery‚Ä¶

Where the hell did you hear that?"
17uekud,k9394s8,"This is a truly awful idea. These early model S are notoriously unreliable and troublesome. Door handle issues, expensive drive unit failures, extremely expensive bodywork. Tesla did this funny thing when they talked about battery lifespan called ‚Äúlying‚Äù.

Buy a 2018+ Model 3 with under 100k miles under $25k. The battery and drive unit are still under warranty, they are more reliable, and importantly, they qualify for the tax credit if you are in the US."
17uekud,k93a1pz,"The car's out of warranty and a very early model.

If your battery or something goes out, nothing is covered and your going to be paying lots of money out of pocket. I would just get a newer model 3 with warranty."
17uekud,k93aokg,"Stay away with any early Teslas, had a 13 S85.  Did well for a couple years then drive motor and battery failing the same year.  $20k in repairs.  140k miles."
17uekud,k93ecar,"The old battery (especially 85kwh) has a higher than normal failure rate.  It might have deserved to be recalled.  Same with the old large motor.

You didn't specify the trim/model of the car and that matters a lot.  A performance and/or RWD car will be less reliable.

Yes, you should be concerned.  It's a $150k car that's 10 years old.  Same caveats as any 10 year old $150k car.  

Air suspension is tricky, old electronics can be finicky, 85kwh battery is prone to high failure rate.

If you can handle that risk, go for it.

But the pre-2016 Model S was a prototype car that has prototype problems.

Beginning in 2017 we're seeing real car reliability, but pre-2016 should be considered prototype cars in a lot of ways."
17uekud,k93xv5j,"For that money buy used chevy bolt 20k miles and have 80k miles of warranty and their labor and parts are cheap compared to tesla 
That my advise 100k on EV is bit risky"
17uekud,k98ixtj,I wouldn't unless you have another $15k sitting around for major repairs
17uekud,k9eknbo,"I have a 2014 P85D MS and it works fine (original owner);  My battery degradation isn't noticeable.  I've got about 76k miles.  Couple of issues i've had with my 2014

&#x200B;

**PAST FIXES**

Had to fix door handles probably 4 times.  Kids pull too hard on them and it breaks the internal mechanism.

There was a recall for a memory chip; Tesla replaced it for free so you might want to investigate that.

My 2014 came with Free Premium Connectivity over 3G.  3G networks are gone now so make sure the car was upgraded to the LTE reciever.

&#x200B;

**CURRENT ISSUES**

Some sort of glue or something is seen in my screen which rests behind the steering wheel.  There's some known defect around this;  Still works fine but kind of annoying.

Rear motor is making some whirring sound.  Normally it should be silent but its making some space age like sound.  Works fine, but not sure what to make of that.

&#x200B;

I have 21"" wheels and i only get about 7000 miles on them.  Partly because i just get on the accelerator probably more than i should, and partly because they're the 21"" wheels.  Each OEM tire is about $530 so bear that in mind.  

&#x200B;

Overall, its a solid car."
17uekud,k9lxopi,Budget for a battery.
17uekud,k93ibob,Also older S batteries are known to have higher failure rates compared to their current ones.
17uekud,k93qx6i,"Musk did say that about the newer batteries in 2019, for what that‚Äôs worth, but definitely not about the 2014 P85 Model batteries."
17uekud,k93ehhe,"That's what they've said, but it's based on cell life.  And battery failures tend to be a couple of cells out of the pack that are outliers and die and short out the whole pack.

This was a huge problem with the 85kwh pack."
17uekud,k94imul,Musk tweeted it in 2019.  [Here](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1117099861273219073)
17uekud,k93enss,"The battery cells absolutely tend to last that long.  It's not lying, it's just talking about cell life expectations.

Problem is the pack can die from a couple of cells shorting out early.

The 85kwh packs seem to be bad that way.  THe newer packs are likely to last way longer as they've figured out the chemistry a lot better.  Still failure rates resemble ICE car's dropping a transmission or engine, which means failures past 120k miles start to add up and get high by 200k miles."
17uekud,k93opl8,"Way off on the original 2014 MSRP (70-85k, $110k for performance but doubt this one is) but some of your other points stand. Don‚Äôt buy this without having an extra $12-14k for a battery and $4-6k for a motor in case of the worst case scenario."
17uekud,k94mxab,"Yeah and he‚Äôs talking about current (2019) Model 3 modules, not 2014 Model S."
17uekud,k9402vf,"$85k in 2014 is $115k today.

But yeah, still it's a pricey car.  My 2017 was $120k and it's not a performance model."
17uekud,k940p2i,My condolences. The MYP I bought for my wife was over $80k OTD with EAP.
17uekud,k9463xf,"I don't have any huge issues with it.  It's worth more than any other similarly priced car today.

Still $30k-ish and that's way better than a comparable priced BMW or Mercedes or Lexus sold in 2017 for the same MSRP (which are in the mid-$20k range at the same mileage).

It's been an incredible car and has free charging for life."
17uekud,k94d3qf,"We love the MYP as well and will keep it for so long the extra few thousand won‚Äôt really matter. And my old MS has been holding up well, and of course also has the free supercharging."
1cwdb5r,l4v15ct,The text below it says you have to disable FSD to change it. FSD Beta only allows single pull to activate for some reason. If you switch back to normal Autosteer you can select double pull to activate.
1cwdb5r,l4vbr18,I wish they‚Äôll allow single pull for auto steer and double pill for FSD. I don‚Äôt always set my destination on the map so I just want the car to stay in lane instead of moving to other lanes when my turn is coming up
1cwdb5r,l4vbhgm,"FSD forcing single pull was meant to reduce issues with people having ""Mode confusion"", where they'd tug on the wheel to disengage FSD, but TACC was still enabled.

Honestly, while I can understand the removal of double pull is annoying if you want to keep TACC, the reality is that having TACC show up *was* unsafe in the long run.  Personally, I'd run into a lot of mode confusion while disengaging the system as it was screwing up on a turn, and forgetting that TACC was still engaged on the other side.

Single-pull/No TACC has been *way* safer for me.

About 90-95% of my driving is all handled by FSD anyways, and when it isn't, I just drive manually."
1cwdb5r,l4vfhx7,"Also the other kind of mode confusion, where you think you pull twice but miss, so it‚Äôs accelerating but not steering.  I had this happen.  Potentially quite dangerous."
1cwdb5r,l4wism7,"I don‚Äôt know why they changed this, but I hate it."
1cwdb5r,l4yfq6h,I wish they would bring back the option of one pull for TACC and two pulls for FSD. Why would they take away choices?
1cwdb5r,l4vf46m,Agreed!!!
1cwdb5r,l4v8rab,Actually beta allowed switching.  They dropped the double pull option when moving to 12 and leaving beta.  I miss the option.  There's a work around using driver profiles but it's a bit ugly.
1cwdb5r,l4v1c07,Thanks silly question what is the difference between fsd beta and auto steer
1cwdb5r,l4vgan1,"I would rather it be fsd on both, but if you have single press enabled, it doesn‚Äôt navigate. During my trial, I liked using fsd like autopilot. But hated that if you don‚Äôt have a destination set, it just goes‚Ä¶ somewhere random without telling you where.

It was nice because I‚Äôm not going to plug things like my mother-in law‚Äôs house in nav when it‚Äôs 7 minutes away and I know where it is. But it was nice to be able to use on the highway bits."
1cwdb5r,l4wjv7e,Use the minimal lane change option
1cwdb5r,l4vk6gq,Thank you for this explanation! It's the best one I've heard and actually makes sense.
1cwdb5r,l4wjxje,Why do you hate it exactly?
1cwdb5r,l4v1txo,"FSD beta is where it drives on city streets, changes lanes, stops at stop signs and traffic lights, and makes turns at intersections. 

Autosteer is the basic Autopilot where it just follows one lane, mostly for use on the highway."
1cwdb5r,l4vtukc,"Best part is that it is also true, because [it's what's written in the NHTSA document here](https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2024/INIM-RQ24009-12199.pdf)

> Item 1: Mode confusion

> Remedy: Add a single-pull activation option for the activation of Autopilot. Enablement of this optional function causes inadvertent steering overrides to disengage both Autosteer and TACC leading to a more pronounced slowdown to alert the driver that Autosteer has been canceled and they must resume immediate control of the vehicle. This function is not default on vehicles who received the remedy in the field and can readily be enabled and disabled by consumers."
1cwdb5r,l4wks0k,My car doesn‚Äôt have cruise control unless I disable FSD for the remainder of my drive. This is mostly an issue when it‚Äôs raining and FSD limits top speed. I‚Äôd rather just set cruise and steer myself.
1cwdb5r,l4v21jh,Is there a difference between auto steer and basic auto pilot?   Also will auto steer cost when my trial is up ?
1cwdb5r,l4wj9h3,It shouldn‚Äôt be impossible to disable everything with a steering wheel pull but still allow TACC with a single pull of the stalk.
1cwdb5r,l4wl150,"You can change it to AP during your drive, which I believe should open the double pull setting, no?"
1cwdb5r,l4v2hm3,Autosteer is the basic autopilot that comes with every Tesla
1cwdb5r,l4wqp91,"""Autopilot"" is the term that encompasses both autosteer (lane keeping) and Traffic-aware cruise control. These 2 features are included with your vehicle and will still be available after your trial at no cost."

5. Autosteer on city streets

1cwdb5r,l4wk20y,"That contributes to mode confusion though.

If you want TACC you can go down to Autosteer."
1cwdb5r,l4wmrtt,"Yeah, but then I think you have to put it in park if you wanna get your FSD back."
1cwdb5r,l4y04pz,"Honestly, autosteer on city streets will work, but not as well."
1cwdb5r,l4wl6dm,"It really doesn‚Äôt.  I‚Äôve definitely been fooled when I disengaged by steering, but I can‚Äôt imagine pulling once and thinking I pulled twice."

16ovyus,k1nfric,"I agree with most of your points and I've been using FSD since 2019. The thing I like most about it personally is seeing the progress it is making. When I first got it, it would not even stop at red lights or stop signs. Changing lanes was much more hectic. FSD didn't ""help"" much, it was actually more stressful to use.

But it has come a long way and it's only going to get better. A few years from now you're going to laugh at how bad FSD was back in 2023. Just enjoy it when you can and keep in mind that it's still very much a work in progress."
16ovyus,k1o6jln,"On highways don't just put it on chill, click the avoid lane changes button. Then initiate lane changes yourself with the turn signal. It's way less stressful that way. The FSd chill to aggressive also effects to follow distance, I set it on normal or aggressive based on the traffic, then turn on the stay in lane. It will still change lanes to follow route, but not until you are close to your exit."
16ovyus,k1oj9ew,"It's basically like having a brand new student driver driving the car.  As long as nothing is weird, they can probably get there.  And I do like how in highway traffic I can spend more time looking ahead and behind than paying attention to the car immediately in front of me.

If you toggle left and right on the right side scroll wheel, you can adjust the driving aggression and set the ""Minimal Lane Changes"" button.  Unfortunately that minimal lane changes setting will reset on your next trip."
16ovyus,k1oc7ch,"One thing to note is the Phantom breaking that you think you are feeling is not that. Phantom breaking is the car violently slamming on the brakes trying to slow down to zero as quickly as it can when it misinterprets something ahead of it like a shadow or oncoming car far off.

What you describe there should be fixed with the newer beta versions that include maintaining flow of traffic. It will bend the speed limit to better Bridge between the speed limit slowing down but the flow of traffic not slowing down. The goal there is to avoid becoming a hazard when the car follows the speed limit but the general public does not or at least not that quickly or immediate."
16ovyus,k1w6e47,"Is it worth $15k now? Arguably not. However as soon as it‚Äôs fully functional, how much will it be worth? I paid $12k for it, figuring there‚Äôs a pretty good chance it will be able to drive fully autonomously at some point while I own the car‚Ä¶ within 5 years? At that point it should make the car way more valuable."
16ovyus,k1ngkpb,"Very objective analysis. This goes to show IMO that the exorbitant amount they are charging for it is a sham plain and simple! This validates why the EU sued Tesla for this gimmick and is NO where remotely close to actual fsd! The subscription route is the way to go NOT coughing up $15K for a beta gimmick! & what makes it even more egregious Elon's  lies..anyone recall when he claimed we would get full fsd by 2020..last I checked, we are almost at the end of 2023 and STILL not even close...that says it all for me!"
16ovyus,k1nbn0a,Was this for FSD 11.4.4? I‚Äôm thinking of giving it a try for a month just to give it a try.
16ovyus,k1rbapf,">any time the speed limit changed to something lower fsd slammed on the brakes even when nothing was in front of me

So, it used to just not apply braking at all when reducing the speed. It would basically just be in neutral, so if the speed limit dropped from 50 to 35 to 25, I either had to disable it and slow down or go 40 in a 25.

NHTSA complained, now it decelerates hard to match your set speed. Honestly, that's fine, it just needs to slowly decelerate prior to reaching the reduced speed section like a normal human being. But unfortunately, that would result in a lot of confusing unnecessary slow downs, because while it can read signs, it mostly relies on map data for speed limits which is pretty commonly not accurate."
16ovyus,k1u1kxg,I bought a 2023 model X 2 days ago with the FSD upgrade.  It was their showroom model so I guess the fsd was not installed yet.

I reserved a car and went We‚Äôd AM to the dealership to pick up. 2 dudes at the delivery desk ask my name and pull up the order. I tell them that the rep in the phone said I get to transfer my 2016 S autopilot in for FSD on this new Y. They were like,,, yeah this is a crazy new promo. I asked if they were certain, they said yes, they looked stuff up. We talked a lot about my high miles 8y0 car and how autopilot was OK but got worse with updates and how I got left in the dust with the BS rebranding to FSD and they were like ‚Äúworth the wait now,‚Äù so I was starting to believe this was true. As I entered info on the app he went out back to everything by someone else and he came back and was like, this is a great deal, I‚Äôm psyched! Because of insurance and payment info that was not going fast they suggested I come back to:or tow to get the car after all the fields in the app wee complete. I paid cash for the full price of the car. A delivery specialist sent docs for me to go over but it did not say FSD. Questioned it and was told they transfer after the sale. I said I want to make sure and an hour later he said I don‚Äôt qualify! Also said if I back out I don‚Äôt get my deposit back. I said I don‚Äôt want a refund want the car with FSD as promised. 2 days and multiple texts and emails to the for details and they are ghosting me 100%.

The rest of my drive was uneventful. It did seem to also be better with left hand turns in residential roads, where previously it would take the turn real tight, driving in what would be oncoming traffic if there was traffic. Today it was staying in appropriate lanes (these are roads with no lane markings).

  


I'll be going out again later tonight, but yeah, I'm loving this update. I've only been on it since the last wide version where it came to Canada.

  


Abrupt stopping.. yes, I experienced that, but it is OK in my books. Perhaps when the novelty of UPLs being successful wears off, the braking may seem a bit much."
v2rzy5,iauewsq,"So far my drives have been much better on this version. I've done four flawless drives, and one drive that required one disengagement: an unprotected left, it waited and accelerated appropriately but wound up in the middle turn lane/""suicide lane"" rather than the appropriate lane, and took too long to change over to the appropriate lane for my liking.

Edit: each drive was about 1.5 miles."
v2rzy5,iau5qss," Visualizations are nice. It‚Äôs no better than the  last version and had 5 disengagements in 5 miles. Car desperately now wants to use the turn lane instead of going straight to a roundabout Roundabouts are silly and awkward, and FSD already tried to assert its dominance and hit a car. Multiple unnecessary lane changes on a straight road with no traffic., car refuses to get into a turn lane early enough with only 1 car occupying the turn lane. Car just wanted to stop in the road after making a right turn. 

Right turns and left turns are better and it‚Äôs slightly smoother when working correctly. So there‚Äôs that."
v2rzy5,iauoxs2,"I love the new visualizations. That‚Äôs the only improvement in my opinion.

It seems to be less hesitant in its decisions, but isn‚Äôt being any *smarter* about those decisions, so an overall resounding negative. For example, all of those little false slowdowns that used to happen still happen, but now rather than a random yet relatively gentle slowdown, they‚Äôre extremely abrupt.

I‚Äôve yet to have it get into the opposite lane it needs for a turn, so maybe there is hope they fixed that."
v2rzy5,iavtigz,"As usual, I saw no improvement.

Changes? Yes. But nothing was improved.

My first drive with it today:

* Within the first mile it tried to pull into 50mph traffic on a left turn. Did so very suddenly while creeping for visibility. 
* still can't handle blinking yellow warning lights properly (tries to slow down hard every blink)
* phantom braking for oncoming cars and cars turning in front of me was honestly worse than usual
* still does not handle residential roads without lines properly. It'll happily ride close to center even if there's an oncoming car, forcing them into the gutter if I don't disengage. Also will get extremely close to parked cars for no reason, which is asking for a door bang.
* still can't read any sign other than stop, yield, and speed limit. Does not handle speed limit variants (like school zones), and doesn't handle roundabouts correctly (treats as a stop sign)

Honestly getting really tired of the promises and lack of improvement. Everything's been reported to Tesla a dozen times now."

v2rzy5,iavav4j,"It‚Äôs always two step forwards and one step back. I have found areas where it‚Äôs been much more confident in the right way, but then like others I have had it do some really weird stuff. At one point while crossing an intersection, it veered off into the oncoming lanes. I stopped it of course - but it was a bit nerve racking. 

Roundabouts - it‚Äôs almost too confident now‚Ä¶ have had to stop it from literally just driving into the circle when cars were coming! I love that it doesn‚Äôt stop for yield signs anymore."
v2rzy5,iavwsvo,"I only drove to and from lunch and home tonight for the first time today, I‚Äôm on the last wave that just got it this morning. It made 2 errors on the drives at lunch and some oddness coming home more than usual. I snapshotted a few instances. Enhanced Visuals Screen frame rate seems to have dropped significantly on atom mcu2 but 3 cameras frame rate remains fine. New Door feature is buggy as hell flickering against contrasting vehicle shades of grey and ghosting itself near side by parking lots. More glowing blue cars or objects on the screen making AP hesitate from all directions now. A couple odd steering wheel twitches where the wheel jerked fast and back. Still hugs the right turn curbs too closely, more than I feel comfortable with, making me disengage AP turn by force to the left. There‚Äôs a long standing iPhone/BT audio bug made worse now in relation to my Apple Watch and phone. But looking forward to testing some more tomorrow. Nag alert seemed noticeably less intrusive or less false positive than before only coming up when I haven‚Äôt held wheel hard long enough. 


Some fresh examples in my memory from today:

Leaving my business on a 35mph 1 lane road up a hill I set it to 40mph and it slowed to 15mph for almost no reason, nothing ahead or behind me, was approaching a T intersection from the right that had to stop facing right so I had right of way with no stop, there was a parked van a few feet back from T on right but it was very stationary; it rolled through very slow when I‚Äôve driven this road dozens of times on prior versions without that happening, will see if it does it again in the same spot tomorrow. 

While traveling on a 2 lane road and with some traffic in front and to the left of me and a school coming up to my right with zero cars parked on the curb (7pm) the car suddenly veered way to the right to recenter itself upon the schools/kids pickup zone/bus spot where the curb greatly opens for a few lengths, there was no painted lines or markers indicating the widened lane but I‚Äôm sure all the cars around me saw me making this stupid looking maneuver to the right then back right away."
v2rzy5,iaw4lpq,Like the new visualizations. I have my first 0 disengagement drive with this version. So far I've had about 5 ish 0 disengagement drives since I got the update.
v2rzy5,iaxxer2,"I've also been a beta tester since first safety-score-100 release in October '21.

This is definitely the worst version yet, since that very first one.  I am now again having to white-knuckle the drives because of very dangerous behaviors.  All other updates, since 10.3 through 10.11, had their problems but wouldn't do legitimately crazy things like swerving into adjacent turn lanes, or trying to hop up over curbs, like this one is.  Had 2 near-collisions for the first time in 7 months.  They were at places that it has not had problems before.  This version is almost entirely regressions, at least in the South West US. 

There are some improvements for sure, like taking the exit lanes more smoothly on highway AP (ironically not FSD).  Also, it looks further out and therefore slows down for stopped traffic / red lights a little sooner.  The takeoff from stop and takeoff through turns is better as well.

But wow, the regressions are shocking.  Driving into medians, missing turns, unable to stay in lane in double-turn lanes, swerving into right-side-parking-lanes on one-way streets.  

I have a feeling, based on the excellent-looking drives on YouTube in California, that they overfit the data to NorCal, and have not had any data from Nevada.  Hopeful they rapidly update the nets on this one, as I'm sure they will."
v2rzy5,iau5okf,Yup same here. Also the sports steering is way loose now
v2rzy5,iavgsx6,Everyone said it's good on roundabouts but today I tried it and it's the same for me it stops in the roundabout and also don't see the street bump. Also visualization looks worse with ghost objects
v2rzy5,iau5qs7,Just updated. I‚Äôm gonna go for a drive in the next hour and see for myself. I appreciate your feedback
v2rzy5,iaupt8q,"Only had a couple short drives but the action around stop signs in my neighborhood is much better. Before it would stop before the stop sign, creep slowly to check for visibility but now it's more confident about going. I think that was one of their bullet points in the release notes."
v2rzy5,iauzw4a,Love the visualization . As far as the drive it feels much smoother making turns and veering to stop cars on my lane moving smoothly with no hesitation.  Drove in the streets 6 miles of LA in heavy traffic had few disengagement as usual  for me feel little improvement  but to be fair need to drive it more  for my final verdict.
v2rzy5,iav6o44,"I drove .5 of a mile earlier to a friends house and had to disengage 3 times. Two of these were at stop signs where it tried to drive into cross traffic, and another because it wouldn‚Äôt get into the turn lane. 

On a second longer drive, it kept on throwing up the take over wheel as soon as it was engaged. The FSD preview was also glitching every few seconds along with the FSD available steering wheel disappearing. 

I parked up for a few mins, locked the car and came back it was still doing the same."
v2rzy5,iav8x3z,"I had a nearly perfect drive to work this morning with much improved left turns and creeping, but on the way home, found a couple of spots where it erroneously and jarringly swerved into parking strips / turning lanes where before 10.11.x did fine.  Two steps forward, one step back‚Äîand I‚Äôm ok with that, mostly."
v2rzy5,iaw91xl,Very pleased so far. I drove around my town last night with no disconnections.  I‚Äôve got to hit my usual list of problem areas to really see extend of the difference.
v2rzy5,ib0h6g1,Still needs work looks like
v2rzy5,ibicvlg,Question: as soon as I enter the highway I lose the FSD visualizations and it reverts to my old AP visualizations. I can see more and see when cars are breaking but I lost the red lines and had to hit the navigate on autopilot button. New to 10.12.2 and just curious if this is normal.
v2rzy5,iaw6r4k,"> Used median at times

Has anybody captured this on video yet? I'd love to see it."
v2rzy5,iauewoc,"I just did a drive down a road I travel multiple times each day.

It's a straight stretch of road, well marked lines, cars parked on the side of the road.

Typically this was a no brainer, very confident & smooth.  Now it jerks to the left and right suddenly every once in a while when a car or garbage can is just the slightest bit in the road.

Think I'll try a reboot, not that that would make any difference, but heck who knows."
v2rzy5,iavxpth,"Wow good to know about the roundabouts, not many beer here but there are a few depending what roads I take."
v2rzy5,iawm7k0,"> and it slowed to 15mph for almost no reason

I've seen this exact problem a couple of times.  It's problematic when your on a road with traffic.

> there was no painted lines or markers indicating the widened lane but I‚Äôm sure all the cars around me saw me making this stupid looking maneuver to the right then back right away.

Yup, this too.  Twice."
v2rzy5,iayk6wb,"Well, I'm in Northern CA., one of the Bay Area counties actually.

Granted it's Napa, so not exactly a place where a lot of FSD Tesla Employees would be driving.  

But I've seen pretty much everything you have (not the curb issue though).

Agreed with you evaluation of the releases since 10/21.  I'm awaiting WholeMarsCatalog's drives, but haven't seen any yet."
v2rzy5,iauekns,"Ah, this is interesting.  I'm not seeing that.

I have another M3 that isn't FSD, it's on 2022.12.3.12 and I *definitely* notice that the sports steering is much loser than my FSD car.  

I still feel it as pretty tight compared to the latest non-FSD version."
v2rzy5,ibihssb,"Normal.

FSD only works on City Streets.  When you get on a highway, it reverts to production AP.

This is what the ""single-stack"" is all about.  It will hopefully be in version 11, but we don't know when that will be.  

Single stack will have the same code for City streets and Highways (and summon apparently)"
v2rzy5,iauft7n,[deleted]
v2rzy5,iaz67rm,"Holy smokes, I just had 2 more near-accidents on a single short drive. Different roads this time.  One was a very straightforward left at a light, technically unprotected but very easy, just a green light from left turn lane, was waiting for oncoming traffic to clear and it just gunned it almost directly into an oncoming car THAT IT SAW AND LABELED BLUE.  About a mile later, it starts trying to change lanes to the right on a 4 lane road (for no reason, I might add) with a car directly next to me slightly behind.  Also labeled the car blue so I assumed it would let him pass, but it just tried to side swipe him! Came within inches before I pulled it back.  It's like the perception nets are fine but the planner/control nets are like ""I see that, but F it I'm just gonna do what I want.""

I'd argue they should RAISE the safety score for new on-comers for this release, not lower it to 95.  You literally have to be hyper-aware and holding on for dear life.  4 near-catastrophic misses in only a few miles of driving. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sweat) 10.12.3 can't come soon enough."
v2rzy5,iauweor,Sorry for being confused. I just got the latest update today and I've been on the FSD beta for a few months now. But my version now reports 2022.12.3.20. How does that relate to the number you gave and to the 10.12.2 that's in the subject line?
v2rzy5,ibii8nt,Thank you for confirming that
v2rzy5,iauipv8,"Yeah, I've seen the inappropriate lane changes.  Like, on the same block where your upcoming turn is, it will change into the other lane.

That's new.  It did make and incredibly tight lane change once.  Ballsy."
v2rzy5,iaz9zl8,"Agreed about the safety score.

No doubt in my mind that its entire purpose was to weed out drivers that can't be hyper-focused all the time.

It's not about ""good driving"".  Maybe for insurance purposes, but not for FSD candidacy.

On another note: I saw something I've not seen before today.  I did probably 20 miles of driving today on various trips on city streets.

At 4pm, I checked my Car's wifi usage.  It had uploaded 110GB of data (not surprising due to all the snapshots I'm taking now), but more interesting is it *downloaded* over 5.5 GB.

I've not seen that before. I guess it *could* be due to the massive upload, but it's not done that before."
v2rzy5,iavaabt,"2022.12.3.20 has FSD version 10.12.2.

You can see it in the Software section in the car."
v2rzy5,ib6spza,"Yup mine uploaded 70 GB in one car and 60GB in the other yesterday. 
Another 2 horrible accidents it tried to cause today. One it just jerked directly out of lane into a parked car, and accelerated right at its rear bumper. 
The second, it got into the farthest LEFT lane on a 4 lane road to make a RIGHT (cutting off 3 straight-going lanes). It hadn't tried to pull that stunt since version 2 SMH. 

Just read they released to newcomers with 98 scores and I'm scared there will be a bad accident and ruin the mission with bad publicity."
v2rzy5,iavch55,"Ah, didn't know that! Thank you!"
v2rzy5,ib6un27,"NO!  They released it to 98s?????  I've not seen that yet.

OMG..."
fej0ux,fjocx4a,"The correct answer is ‚Äúyeah it runs on coal, why cares, are you some green hippie snowflake?‚Äù.

fej0ux,fjoezbb,"You can't argue with stupid, literally. No matter how much evidence you show them, they won't believe it and will just stick to their views regardless. Save yourself some time and braincells by just chuckling and walk away."
fej0ux,fjoncck,"Sorry you had to get roped into the classic eco debate. I'm a Tesla owner and work for the company, so this is something I frequently come across.

As an owner at a local shop or charging station I usually lean into what they are saying, ""Ya it's definitely not good for the environment, I actually was gonna have it converted to diesel fuel next week."" Usually gets a stunned look and no rebuttal, along with the extremely obvious snarky sarcasm.

On the other hand, if they know I work for Tesla it typically has to be a more technical conversation, which inevitably I end up winning as 1. My job requires me to be at the cusp of electrical advances and forward thinking eco solutions. And 2. Because I hit them with usually 4 numeric statistics about the car and company itself that they simply can't refute. (this scenario usually happens at the dog park, coffee shop, or bar.

Best of luck dealing with these going forward. Just remember that they are probably just trying to get a rise out of you and expect exactly that. Don't give it to them."

fej0ux,fjod6ox,"**Coal power in the United States**

Coal power in the United States accounted for 39% of the country's electricity production at utility-scale facilities in 2014, 33% in 2015, 30.4% in 2016, 30.0% in 2017, and 27.4% in 2018. Coal supplied 12.6 quadrillion Btu (3,700 TWh) of primary energy to electric power plants in 2017, which made up 91% of coal's contribution to US energy supply. Utilities buy more than 90% of the coal consumed in the United States.Coal has been used to generate electricity in the United States since an Edison plant was built in New York City in 1882. The first AC power station was opened by General Electric in Ehrenfeld, Pennsylvania in 1902, servicing the Webster Coal and Coke Company.

fej0ux,fjong07,Pumped out of the ground by GODLESS MOSLEMS???
fej0ux,fju8ddf,"Here ya go, for those who wanted it. I've had these numbers for about a year so they are slightly out dated by 13-14 months but rest assured they'll do the trick. Some of these are directly from our IMPACT REPORT, which I recommend all owners should read at some point in time (available on our website for PDF download). I typed them up best I can, they're only normally said in verbal conversation so I hope they sound fluid in my poor sentence structure.

1. With all Tesla's that have been sold/replaced ICE vehicles we have saved well over 4,000,000 metric tonnes of CO2. Which is roughly the equivalent of +500,000 ICE vehicles completely disappearing from earth. 

2. We've installed over 4 Gigawatts worth of solar panels worldwide that have produced 15+ Terawatts in their time operating so far. All 3 current models of the Tesla family have only used around 6 Terawatts of power in their collective lifetime.

3. If you were to convert normal gas into kilowatt energy or reference electricity into gallons by KW power, then on average throughout our line up the MPG would average out to be 135MPGe. No production ICE vehicle currently exists that can do that.

4. To produce 1 gallon of conventional gas it takes approx. 4.6x as much energy as it does to produce the equivalent amount of electricity in KWs. That means to get our power it takes less energy, and when we have our power it is used more efficiently."

1bh8ppv,kvcgrli,Switch to Single Pull for starters. I‚Äôve seen many people think they are in FSD and really on cruise control. Then go out on a quiet highway and try it.
1bh8ppv,kvq2ix2,"Wait, did you get access to beta immediately after paying for FSD??

I had to wait months to get in on my M3 then I traded for a MY last April and paid for two months of FSD and never got beta so I gave up on waiting. I really miss beta and at the end of 2022 it was shockingly smooth and reliable I really want to get it back but don‚Äôt want to pay for it if I can‚Äôt use any of the features."
1bh8ppv,kvqii90,Yes indeed. I was surprise as well. This morning I took a longer drive to take my kids to school and back home. I only have 3 intervention. To my surprise the drive was very smooth and the car behave good in all situations.
1bz1idl,kyn1iac,Just push the accelerator to get to the speed you want and it should hold closer around there. A bug with the auto speed in FSD 12
1bz1idl,kyn7k9c,"This behaviour is new as of the latest version and it‚Äôs extremely frustrating.  Spending far more time babysitting FSD in this release.  Autopilot should be attempting to go at the set speed, not dilly-dallying below it."
1bz1idl,kyn4s3m,"I set mine 10 over and it drives 2-3 under reliably on many roads.  There's clearly an issue still.  It did not have any problem on 11.3, this is a new issue with 12.  Additionally, it seems to be area dependent as I had significantly less issue (though it still didn't go the requested speed) when I was in a different state visiting family.

On limited access highways it seems to figure out what it's doing and goes the requested speed though."
1bz1idl,kyn149u,"Yup, much too slow. Here in NJ it‚Äôs almost unusable unless you want to piss people off."
1bz1idl,kymyn7n,"Sometimes yes. I‚Äôve found that it will pick up the pace when I get passed or if it‚Äôs a road I‚Äôve driven down multiple times. Although it‚Äôs a different stack on the freeway, it blew me away that it was blasting down the highway at 87 mph in a 65 Saturday night. It slowed when we got into traffic thankfully."
1bz1idl,kynt3gl,Mine never did that - until V12
1bz1idl,kynnyk8,"I don't remember what it's called, it's like the auto-determined best speed. I turned that off, my car never goes above speed limit with that on. Make sure you have that off."
1bz1idl,kyovro0,"They screwed something up, FSD was going 50 with my speed limit set to 65 with no one in front of me at all."
1bz1idl,kyn907s,It also drives way too fast in residential neighborhoods and school zones.
1bz1idl,kymz2x1,spin the right hand wheel - which should raise the speed - does that work for you?  Or is it that it doesn't accelerate to the target speed?
1bz1idl,kyn4vwh,"I don't have the trial yet, but can you turn off the ""Offset speed"" function?"
1bz1idl,kyn8f3x,Just step on the accelerator a bit.
1bz1idl,kypacjf,I had the same problem. It has gotten better as I‚Äôve used it more. Idk if there‚Äôs a bit of an adjustment period for the update or what.
1bz1idl,kyqrkwn,Try the new auto speed setting while on assertive mode man.
1bz1idl,kyugc4g,"I am also having this issue in v12. It didn‚Äôt happen in v11. What he done is add a +10% offset which has helped slightly. 

Happens at all speeds highway and city streets. 

Key reason why I could never justify the flat 15k(?) for it.."
1bz1idl,kyncsq7,"Ok, for all those people concerned that their car, when in FSD, is pissing people off, here is what to do:

Buy and attach a bumper sticker for whatever party or candidate you want to have lose. Then let FSD be as annoying as it wants.

;-)"
1bz1idl,kyn1qaw,"I also tried that, it stays for a while, but slowly starts to slow down after a few seconds. Maybe a minute, im honestly not sure. What if I have auto speed off?"
1bz1idl,kyn5iaj,"For me this works to get 2-3 mph more for a few minutes, but 1mph too much and then it suddenly drops back to where it originally was as soon as you let off the accelerator.  Same behavior with either manual or auto speed offset."
1bz1idl,kyo8fu9,"Anyone have the issue where you tell FSD to change lanes, and after a few seconds it basically goes, ‚Äúnaah‚Äù and turns the blinker off?"
1bz1idl,kyuge31,100% agree.
1bz1idl,kyn2p15,"Yea I‚Äôm not using it as much as I used regular auto pilot for that reason. I want to use it tho, just find myself stepping on the pedal a lot and have to keep my hand on the wheels anyways, might as well just drive lol"
1bz1idl,kyn58ng,Oddly mine worked ok (still a bit slow) in Princeton NJ but is absolutely horrendous in Albany NY.
1bz1idl,kyn9ugv,"Same in LA. I‚Äôve only used it on the highway when I see another Tesla going the speed limit, I get in front of them so that we‚Äôre camping out in the right lane together."
1bz1idl,kyn1ema,"Dang what?! I wish mine would operate at highway speeds, I was going 60 in a 70, people were extremely pissed at me"
1bz1idl,kyoenlh,Doesn‚Äôt help.
1bz1idl,kymzag6,"It doesn‚Äôt accelerate to the target speed, for example the other day it was set to 60 in a 55, and it was going 47 and i would have to manually press on the acceleration"
1bz1idl,kyn7pqq,"Does not go to the target speed reliably (if at all). Even overriding with accelerator pedal will move it up a bit, then it falls off.  Very poor behaviour in this version."
1bz1idl,kyn1bbt,No. It appears to determine appropriate speed using something in the software.  Autopilot will go as fast as you tell it to.
1bz1idl,kyn8le8,Doesn‚Äôt help :-(
1bz1idl,kyn4ind,"I‚Äôve tried it off and it seems to do the same thing, only difference is it will only go as fast as your max speed is set vs traffic speed. It‚Äôs annoying but I‚Äôm used to it now and sounds like 12.4 is coming in the next couple weeks so fingers crossed it‚Äôll fix it"
1bz1idl,kyoh6ne,"I have this same problem. It was supposed to be fixed with 12.3.3, but it still drives granny speed for me on both the auto-max and driver selected-max options."
1bz1idl,kyp8df3,Phantom braking 2.0
1bz1idl,kyrwclz,Yes I've seen this in the city. Fsd11/highway is fine.
1bz1idl,kynvy43,"On my way to work at 1am I has to apply turning force, prompt it to speed up, prompt it to change lanes around slower traffic, cancel unnecessary lanes changes, reset TACC speed no less than 8 times because it incorrectly read speed limit signs. Look away from the road to read warnings about occluded cameras, FSD being degraded, poor weather or some other issue only to get beeped at again for looking at the screen to read the warn(ing)s!"
1bz1idl,kyn3hu9,"Yeah, I got places to be, it really annoys me."
1bz1idl,kyn5vy8,I have to take 287 to work.  Lol. It‚Äôs a racetrack in the morning.
1bz1idl,kyn3sb3,Yeah I don‚Äôt know what prompted it to do that because my foot was on the floorboard and it had just passed someone after the on-ramp. There were some cars coming from behind me but otherwise no one else to match speed with. Was chatting with my friend when I looked down and made a comment that apparently the car wants to get us to our destination asap!
1bz1idl,kyn2h4z,"In this event,  press down on the accelerator"
1bz1idl,kynx4wk,"It absolutely willl accelerate to the max speed that you set it to, \*if\* it is safe to. If traffic doesn't allow for it, it will only go as fast as traffic and maintaining a safe distance will allow. It will not just start zipping around slower trafffic because you set a higher max speed, thankfully.  

I did a 70 mile round trip yesterday, with max speed set to 80, and it did go up to 80 just fine, at multiple points. Of course, that was when traffic was also flowing at 80, with plenty of space, and good visibility. 

If it isn't accelerating to the speed you want, then the speed you want is probably not safe for the conditions. That's been my experience with the trial, so far."
1bz1idl,kyn8ifh,"Seems to want to stick to the original speed it set when activating FSD, scrolling speed up doesn‚Äôt get the car to accelerate‚Ä¶ did not observe if it does the same scrolling below original speed."
1bz1idl,kyn667f,"It was working fine for me on 287.  I'm on 12.3.2.1 though, not sure if the earlier 12.3 had an issue.  I drove 287 yesterday with it set for 78 and it did that unless the car in front wasn't fast enough.

I'm driving a 23 MYP."
1bz1idl,kyn51o0,That can help get a couple miles an hour faster for a bit but then it drops back down to where it originally was unless you just manually manage your speed entirely.
1bz1idl,kynxefs,"I wish this was the case. For me, even if the roads are clear it will still drive below the speed limit. The speed limit in my area is 55, and I have it set to 60 but it will drive below 50 mph."
1bz1idl,kyn6bt9,Works fine for me.
1bz1idl,kyn6rwo,Out of curiosity are you hw3 or hw4?  I have co-workers who have the same experience as you but there are all hw3.  I'm wondering if it might be a problem with the hw4 emulation code.  (Currently hw4 vehicles are using emulated hw3 and I've tentatively linked a few other issues to that as well.)
1bz1idl,kyn85j5,Are you on 2024.3.10(or higher)?  Behaves badly for me.
1bz1idl,kyn7gfs,Hw3.
1bz1idl,kyn7zfn,"I‚Äôm HW3, behaves badly for me (FSD since car was new in 2019, upgraded to HW3 in 2020)."
1bz1idl,kynn9qi,2024.3.10
1bz1idl,kyoeuzw,Curious to find out what this bug is if it‚Äôs not doing this for you.  It‚Äôs made FSD extremely frustrating.  That and being too far right in the lane.

16j0un1,k0nkwjk,The problem is the bmw is blocking the door. I would use the ladder and push the ac unit onto his car.
16j0un1,k0o2ggx,Easy when you have accurate parking sensors ;)
16j0un1,k0qupf2,I bet they tailgate that close too
16j0un1,k0rfdd2,Which one is the ass-hat who parked second?

16j0un1,k0spgwf,Just let the air out
16j0un1,k0nl5mm,I think they were bumped off.
16j0un1,k0otyg6,I like that take. I was thinking maybe they‚Äôre just friends messing around. I demand to have positive thoughts.
16j0un1,k0ox6uc,That was my thought as well

16j0un1,k0nke1m,BMWs park assist is so good that they can actually do this. I'm 100% sure they didnt rely on Tesla's cams to do this
16j0un1,k0ndc1v,Same family...X5 and M3
16j0un1,k0njyzg,How do you know which car parked second? Am I missing something?
16j0un1,k0nut07,Boring answer: It wouldn‚Äôt work. No chance the Tesla is going to allow Summon to work with something that close.

16j0un1,k0nl7ri,Just pulling out will do the same damage
16j0un1,k0otjmo,It's hard to tell if the trim on the Tesla is chrome or black. If it is chrome then this one also does have USS. Even black trim you have to account for years of those being produced with USS.
16j0un1,k0rglmk,Car with blocked driver door parked first.
16j0un1,k0pllnv,"Happened to me once. I'm sure there was great disappointment when I used the app to pull the car out of the space, hop in, and go."
16j0un1,k0o366s,The problem is you're assuming this isn't a dealership or an exotic/high end car rental place or something where those cars are owned by the business.

16gzaeb,k0bnage,"Seems like distance would depend on speed according to tesla description.  I just try to slow down if someone is cutting into my lane .  Only factors on speeds over 50

If you haven‚Äôt seen - https://www.tesla.com/support/safety-score#version-2.0

Your Tesla vehicle measures its own speed, the speed of the vehicle in front and the distance between the two vehicles. Based on these measurements, your vehicle calculates the number of seconds you would have to react and stop if the vehicle in front of you came to a sudden stop. This measurement is called ‚Äúheadway.‚Äù Unsafe following is the proportion of time where your vehicle‚Äôs headway is less than 1.0 seconds relative to the time that your vehicle‚Äôs headway is less than 3.0 seconds. Unsafe following is only measured when your vehicle is traveling at least 50 mph and is incorporated into the Safety Score formula as a percentage. Unsafe following while on Autopilot is not factored into the Safety Score formula. The percentage shown in the app is the percentage of unsafe following when driving and Autopilot is not engaged. The value is capped at 64.2% in the Safety Score formula."
16gzaeb,k0bnyxp,"So I just have to assume that at 65-75mph (I-10 speed limit where my commute is), the distance between myself and the next vehicle should be ~4-5 seconds (assuming a sudden stop is necessary) to avoid triggering the unsafe distance. This'll probably annoy other drivers as they tend to ride close. I'll just have to farm lower percentages in the right lane."
1bj0dnb,kvnziwh,The lane change vibrate.... has this worked for anyone?
1bj0dnb,kvp010j,"I use TACC a lot on the interstate when FSD can‚Äôt activate for some reason or another. The reasons thus far: fender cameras blocked due to not properly shedding water from road spray, fender cameras think they are obstructed when it is actually just really dark (really remote, late at night, no other traffic), and FSD deciding 20 under the speed of traffic is what‚Äôs appropriate for conditions, even though conditions are fine (and has handled it well in the past).

I guess I‚Äôll have to disable FSD for road trips if there is any chance of it being dark or the roads wet. What sucks is the Autopilot stack will slow down in the interstate for any flashing yellow, such as a deer warning sign or a sharp turn sign. Not just slow, but try to control for it as if it is a traffic light. This issue has been in the autopilot stack for over 3 years now."
1bj0dnb,kvrg5um,I have never used TACC. I am either FSD or I am fully driving.
1bj0dnb,kvs20b8,"It's the single pull setting. If you switch to double pull it behaves normally.

It makes sense if you think about it... you only have 1 switch... it can only enable 1 thing."
1bj0dnb,kw9yvoi,"Yeah just got 12.3 and the same for me. I use TACC more than FSD because, well it's FSD and it works properly 10% of the time. Am I understanding correctly that if you have FSD enabled, you don't get TACC?"
1bj0dnb,kx1hgkl,I downgraded to autosteer. I use TACC a lot because it‚Äôs less fussy and more functional for me. If Tesla wants me to use full self driving so that they can collect data about what I do with my car then they should try not to defeature it like this.
1bj0dnb,kvp08m0,"I only use the vibrate setting, it works great for me."
1bj0dnb,kvo2ij4,I doubt if anyone used that.... didn't even want to try it
1bj0dnb,kvvdi88,Almost same here...
1bj0dnb,kvs3qz5,The option to toggle is disabled in FSD v12
1bj0dnb,kvs4vte,"You never could toggle while it was actively engaged though?

You had to disable everything, flip the setting & then re-enable (from memory!)  


That being said, I'm still on 11 something so can check later!"

vfvsgv,icy1d6k,Charging to hundred is not an issue. Keeping it there for an extended period of time is. Cars are made for supercharging. Just only charge it to 100% if you need the range.
vfvsgv,icylu9j,"This might be more of a software thing, but Tessie was telling me my battery's capacity was around 69kWh (nice), and in the last month I've had to use quite a few superchargers and now it's telling me my capacity is more like 71kWh.

Normal use, my car's charged on 110v 90% of the time, only ever use L2 or superchargers when I'm road tripping."
vfvsgv,icza5xk,"OP, how many years/miles did you keep your last car before you got rid of it? The answer to that question will answer your worry about battery life on this car.

If you have an LFP car, charging to 100% is good

If you have a non-LFP car, charging to 90% is fine.

vfvsgv,icyo4vr,"A little, but probably not much."
vfvsgv,icz0kuj,"For me, the biggest issue with charging to 100% is the lack of regen. I only do it before long roadtrips."
vfvsgv,iczozrt,"No, the charging itself doesn't change. Your charger is built into the vehicle itself and is made to balance charge the vehicle and trickle charge the last 20-30 percent of the battery to prolong it's life ( that's why charging drastically slows)"

vfvsgv,j3yb1u1,With lfp battery you have regen also at 100% soc
vfvsgv,icy6zny,"This is just so totally wrong. 

If you bought a base model 3 after about July-September of 2021 then you likely have an LFP battery. It will not have the trip vs daily indicators on the charging screen where you set the charge limit. 

If you have a base model 3 with the LFP battery, then you can charge to 100% and it will not damage the battery nearly as much as charging a lithium ion battery to 100%. Tesla even recommends charging the LFP battery to 100% at least once per week. 

If you own literally any other tesla than a base model 3 manufactured in the last 12 months or so, then this does not apply to you and charging to 100% regularly will cause significant additional degradation of your battery pack."
vfvsgv,icy1apv,I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs just a 2021 model 3

vfvsgv,icyp442,"they recommend 90%, but people do 80% or even 70%, 
as long as the range at that % you are comfortable with"
vfvsgv,iczpfmc,"true. OP mentioned in another comment that the car is a 2021 model, so likely 262 NCA or 253 LFP, if 2022 thats for sure 272 LFP"

vfvsgv,icyyxs6,"For what it's worth, the recommendation is to charge them to 100% at least once a week.  They not only can be charged to 100%, Tesla wants you to do it with some frequency."
vfvsgv,id14c6c,Or it's pushing the electricity generated from regen breaking somewhere else? Heating the battery pack?
vfvsgv,icyu3ce,Here is some info about lithium ion batteries from [the university of Michigan](https://news.umich.edu/tips-for-extending-the-lifetime-of-lithium-ion-batteries/) on the matter.
vfvsgv,icze0bf,Thanks for correcting me! Appreciate it!
vfvsgv,id31odi,For anyone reading this who isn‚Äôt aware- this is referring to LFP batteries on the RWD. Not NCA batteries on the LR or P.
vfvsgv,id14xby,"That's why I said 'pretty much' - the energy could be dissipated as heat in either the battery or the motor(s). 

It doesn't taken long for the battery level to drop and regen to return, in my case. Worse on colder days, much better once it's above 5 degrees C ish."

qfncaf,hi0rl4n,"When I took my test drive, my SA suggested I place an order to lock in the price. I thought it was a sales tactic until a week or so later there was a 1K increase.  I placed my order a week after that and have seen it go up another 3K."
qfncaf,hi0no47,"Yeah. I knew my test drive would cost me whatever a long range 3 cost at that time..

So delayed until my Volt was totalled."
qfncaf,hi0qddu,Happened to me in July. The day we did a test drive and decided to order one is the day the price went up by 1k :(
qfncaf,hi0xm0j,MYP It is dude..
qfncaf,hi0uaek,Bad luck on your timing.  That's all.
qfncaf,hi0wd7v,"Same here, ordered my Y a couple days after another price increase in April. I think I've saved about $6K since then, though, so I'm happy."
qfncaf,hi0mu27,Good news is if price drops they will give the lowest between reserving and delivery I believe.
qfncaf,hi14gfw,I am literally in the same position. I'm going to put down a reservation today before it jumps in price again.
qfncaf,hi177ic,"Actually I was trying to order a MS, and since I have never driven any EV, I was thinking about test driving a MY before I ordered it. Same thing happened to me and the price went up 5k before I ordered one which made me go with MYP. Actually looking back it was still a deal to order it by then since Tesla jacked up another 10k after that. Still I got my car probably 8-10 months earlier and drove it for 3000 miles and I think that is better than waiting for that MSLR to come until sometime next year. Maybe I will reconsider it when they have 4680 upgraded for MS."
qfncaf,hi1ldgl,"I am right there with you.  Last Monday I finally made an appointment to test drive a Model Y on the following Saturday.  I was so excited last week since this was my first opportunity to drive a Tesla.  Woke up Saturday morning and was completely gutted seeing the raised price.  I know there was one a few weeks ago, but I assumed it would be awhile before another one.  Despite feeling like crap I went ahead and did the test drive.  As soon as I drove the car I forgot about the price hike.  I really enjoyed it and decided to put in my order that day.   I still feel a bit raw about how it went down, but in the end I am glad I put in my order.  There will probably be more price hikes before I get my car in May, along with a new group of frustrated buyers.  Sometimes that is just how it goes.  I will say that I have spent a lot more time thinking about my future Model Y than the $2k I lost out on."
qfncaf,hi1mhy6,"When I put my deposit down in mid 2019, they required a $2,500 deposit. I learned so much about the company , I decided to also buy $2,000 worth of their stock , which I still have now. Thankfully. Love this car and the company !
Afraid of future maintenance issues however."
qfncaf,hi1qux1,"I test drove MYLR mid March and during the test drive, SA whispered to me ‚Äúlook, I get no commission on this. But price will be going up and we‚Äôre expecting delivery delays in the future.‚Äù Thought he was trying to play me so I didn‚Äôt place the order on site, but did place the order later that day when I said screw it. Took delivery in late March (2 week wait). Since then‚Ä¶ 10k price jump + 10 month waits nowadays. Shoutout to that SA for looking out"
qfncaf,hi0qj3u,[deleted]
qfncaf,hi0ykzz,Exactly what I did in May when I ordered a Model X with January EDD. I have 7 months to decide if want to buy it or just waste $100.
qfncaf,hi15zsb,I'm one of those that ordered a MYLR then test drove it two months later. I had done enough research to make an educated guess that I'd like it and would fit in it as a bigger person. The test drive only served to make me more anxious to take delivery of the car.
qfncaf,hi1m6jk,Hello preach let me introduce you to the choir. :3
qfncaf,hi1qgm2,This is the way
qfncaf,hi27py6,Could always get perf. I don‚Äôt think they raised that as much and less of a wait. I‚Äôve considered it a few times since placing my order just because of how long the wait is. Only thing stopping me is that I locked in before the last 2 increases.
qfncaf,hi2bttc,"You ‚Äòlate to the party‚Äô guys are funny. 

Ordered my mY on 4/15/2019"
qfncaf,hi2fyde,"Feel you. Spent a week deciding to order, and the price went up in the middle of me pulling the trigger."
qfncaf,hi2yorr,"Wow, guess I saved us the same by suggesting an earlier test drive!"
qfncaf,hi3qr77,Price increased 2 days before I ordered mine. It is what it is. It‚Äôll keep going up and then you‚Äôll feel better you ordered when you did.
qfncaf,hi3xhx4,"Yea I put the order in before telling the wife or scheduling the test drive. 

It‚Äôs easier to ask for forgiveness than permission. 

I think that‚Äôs how it goes‚Ä¶.. ;)"
qfncaf,hi55jdq,"The opposite happened to me, I ordered in December(29th) 2020, price went DOWN 2 weeks later, received a check for $1500 like 2 months later."
qfncaf,hi6rdhk,"Not to brag, but I‚Äôm gonna. I bought my 2021 sr+3 when they dropped the price by 1k to 36,990. Since then there have been like 3-4 price increases. It‚Äôs now a 44k car. Funny thing is I sold my 2019 sr 3(w/autopilot) after two years of owning to carvana for 34,550 will 11k miles. Talk about a steal."
qfncaf,hi1nvfm,"Yeah SAs don't get commission, no hard sales. Dude was looking out for ya."
qfncaf,hi15eqq,Placed an order 3 weeks ago for M3SR+ and in those 21 days price went up $4k
qfncaf,hi1n2zx,"I had the same thought when I was ordering mine long ago, but it turned out I was actually ordering during the last week of the production cycle. If I had ordered any later, I would have had to wait months to get the car."
qfncaf,hi53zf9,same. exact. scenario happened to me haha
qfncaf,hi1plf7,I hope no one was injured. How did the Volt hold up in the crash?
qfncaf,hi0vuov,I was right there with you lol
qfncaf,hi3whds,Happened to me. I test drive in July and ordered day after. Price went up 1k the morning I ordered.
qfncaf,hi0ztnz,"This is the way. Only a $5k difference now. Unless you need 7 seats, I agree."
qfncaf,hi0n7gx,"Hey we can hope. I don‚Äôt expect it to drop though but if they pass an EV credit, the waiting list will triple. So it‚Äôs good to have a spot regardless."
qfncaf,hi0ofrf,There is no chance the price will drop with the backlog they have. Why would they?
qfncaf,hi0vjbn,Have prices ever dropped ?
qfncaf,hi1dpe2,"It's definitely a deal if you look at it now, but back then there was no way to know. They didn't even start producing that many until like August. You could order in August and sit next to people who ordered in December and were still waiting. 

After seeing it go up $15K I'll never hesitate again, but still, at the time it doesn't seem crazy to go that route."
qfncaf,hi1myfx,That‚Äôs the same time I bought my 3. What has caused you to fear maintenance? I have had zero issues.
qfncaf,hi0uu57,"Are you sure about the fee? I can just log in and edit my order right now, but I will be updated to the latest pricing and may lose my delivery spot. 

I had actually changed my order without realizing the base price had changed but my SA was able to discount $2000 back. Still out $2000, but not as bad as it was."
qfncaf,hi2e7jy,Yeah they didn‚Äôt raise P at all. But I wanted 7 seater.
qfncaf,hi2e98b,That‚Äôs when I ordered my 3.
qfncaf,hi3xxek,This is the way
qfncaf,hi5dfoh,You had already paid in full?
qfncaf,hi2f5nz,"Volt did its job.

Hit from behind at around 30 by a civic... hit a small Volvo in front of me.

4 months out of work due to concussion... migraines and headaches, some hearing loss, get double vision w/some migraines...

Get under insured motorist coverage, more than you think. His and mine will barely make health insurance co. whole with little left over."
qfncaf,hi17soc,7 seats is not an option for P?
qfncaf,hi0ueqc,On the other hand production is going to quadruple in the next year or two.

qfncaf,hi0pj3z,To assert dominance ^^^/s
qfncaf,hi0t377,Because their goal is to move the world to sustainable transportation.   They have cut prices often in the past.  So once the supply chain gets sorted and berlin/giga get mostly scaled they will be able to start lowering again.
qfncaf,hi0wa6q,"yes, they have."
qfncaf,hi0wbpk,Yes lots just not in the past year.   Supply chain and two new factories have pushed the prices up
qfncaf,hi1jzoj,"When I was looking at it back in July, the EDD quickly moved from December to Feb, and I still believe if I order back then I won‚Äôt get it until April next year. Also at current price MSLR is less attractive to me and I might go with Audi etron gt instead. Actually MYP satisfies almost all my needs so it might stay for another 3-4 years, and I hope by then the charging infra will be good enough for me to look at options from other manufacturers."
qfncaf,hi1oy63,"No major issues, but anything has taken time, sometimes days. Now look at how fast they‚Äôre cranking the cars out. I hope they are scaling the business, the repair shop and the supercharging at a similar rate as sales."
qfncaf,hi1ddiv,"There's never been a 'change fee'. The only loss is maybe if the price increased like you said, but sometimes they can refund that back. Not sure if that's always the case or what, but there's definitely never been a fee."
qfncaf,hi5ejs6,"I didn't pay in full no, but technically speaking they received the loan from my bank already."
qfncaf,hi2nfdb,If you don‚Äôt mind. How much was the total coverage?
qfncaf,hi17xgz,Correct. And they used to be $7k apart. $5k and allegedly earlier delivery date makes it a much more interesting proposition.
qfncaf,hi0scwy,You don't have to call in. They update automatically
qfncaf,hi0pykw,"Haha, I only hope! I get your /s, but until real competition and many are flocking to other brands, law of supply and demand will prevail."
qfncaf,hi1w1gs,"Let‚Äôs not kid ourselves their main goal has always been money. The sustainable transportation aspect of it was an added bonus that could be marketed from a PR perspective to appear less greedy, but it‚Äôs always been about the money."
qfncaf,hi0yw9j,"Technically it did drop this year, in February. Price of Model Y went from 49.9 to 48.9 for a few weeks.

This guy tracks them pretty well.  Look at slide at 3:30 into the video."
qfncaf,hi1rfve,"I'm interested in some other EV's but would still want to do multiple test drives to see if it's worth switching off of Tesla. I've loved German cars for a while and the M3 was my dream car, but after getting a Model 3 I completely forgot about it. 

The charging infrastructure might be blown open in 3-4 years. If Tesla opens theirs to other EV's and more non-Tesla chargers pop up due to the increased # of EV's, then it might be workable. Even then, it's always possible to just get an EV for commuting + local stuff and ignore the charging problem altogether. I really like the new Ford truck but it doesn't have anything that makes me want to roadtrip in it, unless the range is that good. And even then, it would be because the battery is huge so charging that up will not be fun."
qfncaf,hi5eoju,You ordered and received your car within 2 weeks?
qfncaf,hi3ekbq,They had $80k I have $100k
qfncaf,hi1daru,I ordered 7-seater. If I decide to forgo that (a $3k option) then it‚Äôs really only $2k difference.
qfncaf,hi1zkqf,"It was a $10k difference when we ordered our MYP, but fortunately LR was never an option and the price for MYP hasn't changed much (if any), so we don't have FOMO."
qfncaf,hi3wohb,"Definitely not true.  100% untrue.  It was wallstreet that wanted it.  How many times has Tesla said if you don‚Äôt want volatility don‚Äôt invest or saying the stock is too high.   Or lowering prices, etc."
qfncaf,hi0z80t,Excellent.  Thank you.
qfncaf,hi5f5h8,"No, I ordered, and received in 2 months, but I paid with a loan right away, and afterwards saw the news that the price went down, and asked for an adjustment on my car before I receive it"
qfncaf,hi3x8qi,I wished the P came with 7 seater. I would even take a speed hit if anything. I‚Äôll be happy with 3.8 or something.
qfncaf,hi4ffbv,"LOL Tesla doesn‚Äôt give a shit who invests or buys their stocks, money is money, and like any business they want more of it."

You're right that people with shorts on Tesla have an incentive to bash Tesla. But the mainstream news doesn't take stock positions. It publishes what people will read. Yes, some people sharing those stories might have short positions. But the stories will often also be read by people with long positions. 

tl;dr news company incentives explain the rash of negative stories better than short-seller incentives.

7fe0my,dqbom7b,"I suspect the US big three is waging a social media compaign to disadvantage Tesla. The big three have been anti-tesla since the beginning. They are still fighting Tesla in the courts to compete in their states. BTW, Seeking Alpha's Tesla articles are incredibly negative."
7fe0my,dqbiwv5,"Can someone explain why people who know absolutely nothing about electric cars (and have barely seen one) try to argue with EV drivers using all of these talking points and the usual anti-EV tropes? 


People like your co-worker, or the stereotypical Aunt/Uncle who comments on all your Facebook posts. I mean, they have absolutely nothing to gain from it, and nothing to lose from people buying EVs, so why are they so committed to bashing them?"
7fe0my,dqboejo,"I used to let it get to me (shareholder since 2013) and now I'm grateful for it because it keeps price low and the stock extra jumpy.  

Now my personal theory:  Tesla got ahead of this by adding James Murdoch to the board.  Whenever Rupert passes (he's 87) you will see an immediate switch.  News corp will change their coverage from that point on, also Tesla should be in much different shape by then.  

2018 is the year for Tesla, everything else has been building up to the model 3 & autopilot advances and hopefully hitting 100k cars 4q2018.  With that many happy new customers, there will be no stopping them and those fools will still be saying the same crap."
7fe0my,dqbb3ms,"This has been going on for years.  I paid attention to every negative article when I was a shareholder and when the company was just getting started (Superchargers first being announced, vast majority of the country still without any SC‚Äôs at all). 

Yes many of them are from short sellers and of course there has to be some level of attempted sabotage from the oil industry too.  Zero question about it.  Best thing you can do is tune out the clickbait articles."

7fe0my,dqba7a0,"The best ones are those that argue EV are more polluting than ICE. Hey I admit you can create some situations where that might be true. But what‚Äôs the plan they have instead, carbon capture coal powered cars? It‚Äôs ridiculous. Clearly the only way you are going to get zero carbon transport is to generate renewables capture the energy somehow and use that to power the car, after that it‚Äôs just how you can do it more efficiently."
7fe0my,dqbdnbl,"Honest question, since this post has raised a talking point I‚Äôm hoping some people here are more knowledgable on.

I‚Äôve been seeing some stories on Tesla‚Äôs liquidity due to sales not hitting targets in the US.

Is this true? Or part of a smear campaign?

If it is true, is there an appetite in the US for electric cars on such a scale?

Personally in Europe I‚Äôve started seeing models S/X pop up everywhere and I‚Äôm awaiting to see how much the 3‚Äôs come up for. I‚Äôm eagerly awaiting the launch of the 3.

The story only caught my eye since I‚Äôm jealous and wished they‚Äôd launched the 3 here earlier if it‚Äôs not selling well in the US (although I suspect the story was hyperbolic)."
7fe0my,dqbpy8j,"Man I love the concept of Tesla, the work they do, and would love to have one. The best that I could get was a Chevy Volt and I love it. EV cars are the future and anybody who tries to stop it is hurting themselves and the rest of the world."
7fe0my,dqbpzwa,Pretty much the entire old school media establishment spins negative any news out about Tesla musk or his other companies.  It is pathetic crony journalism at its best. Trying to extend the life of be long dying status quo that should have died decades ago. I call it the incestuous circle jerk of the pedophilactic capitalists established in the 1800s
7fe0my,dqbr0rp,Yes! In particular from Bloomberg's direction.
7fe0my,dqbuhw4,"What Elon is doing also runs directly against Russian interests. SpaceX has just made the market for their Proton rocket evaporate, and will soon take NASA astronauts, and possibly others, from the Soyuz. Tesla is on course to disrupt the fossil fuel industry, one of the pillars of Russian economy.

Elon was always fearful from some Russian spy killing him, but now he might be a target for Russian bots of misinformation doing a general smear campaign against him, as there is no election for them to mess up for a while."
7fe0my,dqb8219,"Tesla fanatics do trend towards a persecution complex. Tesla takes risks, and gets talked about a lot in the media because if it. Maybe I'm being too obvious here, but taking risks comes with it's share of risk, and people are going to argue about that. I'm not sure what else you were expecting."
7fe0my,dqbiy3t,notice? there has been a campaign against him since at least 2010. it really heated up in 2012. 
7fe0my,dqbkbwx,I talk about him to my grand father and he keeps getting worse and worse opinions about him I really wonder where he is reading his stuff.
7fe0my,dqbmm0y,"Isn‚Äôt that par for the course though. GM, Ford etc do not want Tesla to succeed and make an inferior product. They cannot sell their product so they are going to smear yours."
7fe0my,dqbp0ol,I see it all the time and it just looks like crazy people repeating the same point over and over again.  All they can say is how Tesla survives off the tax breaks which is a laugh considering how much money all other corporations get compared to Tesla.  
7fe0my,dqbpr2q,It's the same thing big pharma does against marijuana.
7fe0my,dqc8w8b,"> General fud about Tesla's financial position

This one is the most glaring.

7fe0my,dqbn16b,"I wonder WHO could be producing massive amounts of disinformation on social media to discredit tesla? I mean, it's like they already have a huge built-in system ready to go.

7fe0my,dqbgcfa,"Let's go through your ""smear"" points one by one:

>Tesla unable to scale up production

Are you going to pretend they don't have serious production issues?

>Tesla cars catching fire (you can thank the mainstream media for picking up this bullshit story and spreading it)

Cars catching fire make the news pretty regularly.  I don't hear complaining when there's a story about a BMW or Mercedes that caught fire.

>Autopilot causing accidents

The media giveth and the media taketh away.  If you want all the press that comes with a hype campaign around Autopilot, you're going to see the flip side when crashes happen.

>Tesla ""making record quarterly losses"" (this one is particularly deceitful because the quarterly losses were forecast and planned due to scaling up production, and these headlines make the reader think they are going under when in fact it is completely normal)

Are factual statements considered FUD now?  They made a record quarterly loss while missing major production targets and scaled back production of other vehicles because they have too much inventory.  Are you expecting that to *not* be mentioned?

>Tesla workforce issues (most recently that story about racism that was no more than what other large companies deal with on a daily basis)

[Citation needed]

>Rumours of Elon leaving Tesla (As if he would)

Well first of all, the whole thing stems from Elon saying he'd stay with Tesla through the Model 3 a while back, which obviously brought up the question of why he'd pick that specific milestone if he wasn't considering a departure.  Second of all, this is not a ""smear campaign"" point, it's something that's been brought up by [Tesla fan blogs](https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-to-leave-tesla-motors-after-model-3-release/) for years.

>Sowing doubt about Tesla cars range to spread range anxiety

Haven't seen much of this, but that's just me.

>General fud about Tesla's financial position

Well when you lump any factual statement that isn't pro-Tesla as ""fud"", yeah, you're going to see a lot.  Tesla's financial position is horrible.

>False assertions that Tesla cars produce more pollution than petrol cars due to electricity production and manufacturing

Is that a Tesla smear campaign or just a part of the general anti-science anti-climate change group?

>We need to make people aware of these efforts so that they don't believe this crap.

No, we need to remind people to think critically and not take things at face value regardless of whether they come from SeekingAlpha, Bloomberg, or Elon himself."
7fe0my,dqbj8od,"Positives...  
Tesla is great at designing greatly enjoyable cars.  
Tesla is great at keeping the hype behind their cars going.  
Tesla has been able to create a brand (largely focused on Elon Musk being the head of Tesla) that rivals and surpasses that of even Apple.  
Tesla has successfully disrupted the auto industry and pushed just about every single established OEM to consider and/or invest in EV technology.  
Tesla is morphing into an all encompassing company as it relates to energy usage and production.   

Negatives...  
Tesla is still, by their own admission, relatively poor at mass producing vehicles.  
Tesla is not a huge company, and is spending cash at an amazing rate (though I‚Äôd argue with very solid reasons to do so).  
Tesla sets relatively unrealistic goals which are made public and draw criticism.  

As far as I‚Äôm concerned, there is no real compelling reason today to choose a vehicle from any other company.  
This is for me personally, and until all vehicle types are made by Tesla I could see why this wouldn‚Äôt work for everyone.  "
7fe0my,dqbkjgy,"""They"" are very scared of all the industries Tesla and Elon are innovating. 

Current form capitalism and the way it thrives is by shutting down innovation and trickling out advancements. Elon does things differently and isn't maximizing profits as the establishment would like so they want to take him down. "

7fe0my,dqblqf9,One of the benefits of being in the Midwest. Most people I talk to now are curious about Tesla cars and are willing to listen. 
7fe0my,dqbmhhh,The reason for this is TSLA stock is one of the biggest shorted stocks on the market. Lots of people are betting big money on TSLA going down.

He always says how he doesn‚Äôt understand why people would wait for years to buy a Tesla when they can go out and buy a Chevy Bolt today. That‚Äôs the thing, he just doesn‚Äôt understand, Tesla has a following and people love the cars. Hell, they can have an event where they reveal a Semi Truck, something 99% of Tesla drivers will never drive, and it‚Äôs still the hottest ticket in town and watched by many on live stream. And after the surprise Roadster reveal, I don‚Äôt think anyone will miss another reveal because you never know what surprise might happen.  "

7fe0my,dqbdmab,Yes. Tesla hate is at an all time high. People seem to believe that Tesla will be bankrupt in a short while. They'll have a rude awakening when Model 3 mass production is in full swing next year.
7fe0my,dqbioae,"HAHAHAHA

Streisand effect! Called it.

As a bitcoin holder forcing shorts to realize their losses, AKA the ""short squeeze"" is the funniest thing ever. This is what winning looks like. This is their desperation because real money is on the line and they are losing their shirts.

BWAHAHAHA

This is what they get for betting against the future.

In the right situations I really love capitalism.

Edit: in fact the trading bots that these asshats replaced their staffs with trade on key words, just keep repeating ""short squeeze"" a few million times and you win."
7fe0my,dqbiv9a,"On the point about Elon leaving Tesla, didn‚Äôt he publicly say that in the past?  
I recall him saying that with the successful launch of the Model 3, he would have accomplished his goal with Tesla and will move on to new endeavors.  
As he is currently running Tesla + SpaceX + Boring Company maybe his departure from Tesla doesn‚Äôt actually need to happen?

7fe0my,dqb8mub,What was the problem with the car catching fire?
7fe0my,dqbkx9q,Whenever there is a real threat to change the automotive industry and take away trillions in profit from them they‚Äôre going to hate. Oil companies don‚Äôt like this. GM former CEO already had publicly stated his hate and says Tesla is going bankrupt. Other car companies don‚Äôt like the fact that Tesla is the future. Mechanics don‚Äôt like this either for obvious reasons. Elon is one of the only people doing something great with his ideas by turning them into realities. Many in the world who have benefited in the past simply aren‚Äôt ready to take a financial ‚ÄúL‚Äù to Elon and the Tesla brand.

Imagine this: you are sitting at a table with three people, once from each of the domestic (and semi-domestic) automakers.  You or someone else brings up Tesla.  The Ford person is fairly impressed by Tesla, and might talk about the advanced electronics and communication systems.  The Chrysler person might express some uncertainty about purely battery powered cars in general, but overall has respect for the company and product.  The GM guy is different.  He starts going on about one of more of a set of basically talking points that seem circulated to most GM employees. They will talk about how those cars have major problems, they break down frequently, they have serious quality control issues and almost half of the vehicles are refused for delivery and sent back for repairs, the batteries are having big issues with early failures, how Tesla is filing for bankruptcy and they know this because someone they know who works for one of Tesla's suppliers told him about Tesla not paying them for over a year and now sending some sort of notice suggesting an imminent chapter 11 filing.

7fe0my,dqbijxy,Absolutely aware of irresponsible journalism misrepresenting rhe facts. Reason why myself and others write to keep public lens *focus* on real time. Ultimately efforts of Tesla's mission are to produce cars and create sustainable  energy sources. Hence reduce CO2 emissions destroying sustainable life of Earth.

7fe0my,dqbldfd,"While some worry I find it hilarious. See, news sites have found that anything Tesla is click bait, so even a bad story gives Tesla free advertising. After years of story's of ""Tesla going bankrupt"" people will wonder about this car they have heard so much about and eventually get hooked when they experience it.

 (**political warning**: I hate to make this comparison, but I'm just making an observation.) It is kind of the same formula that got Trump elected. News channels loved running  the click bait articles about Trump and inadvertently gave him billions of dollars of free advertising. "
7fe0my,dqblg36,Who keeps the electric car down?
7fe0my,dqc8eun,"This is glorious. But we didn't become complacent. Tesla gets its power primarily from grass roots. People like us. We need to keep bringing it up and how great shifting to sustainable energy is. This isn't only for Tesla, but any EV.

7fe0my,dqbdo0s,"Assuming it's true that a) these news items are unfounded and b) are a deliberate smear, what's the end game? They sink money into maintaining the short position for ages *and* on smear PR... but eventually, Tesla *will* churn out 3's so the doubt they sow becomes untenable, so they'll *still* close their position at a big loss anyway. What's the end result they are hoping for, that the smears will become self-fulfilling and actually *cause* an otherwise strong Tesla to go under?

It doesn't strike me as inconceivable that there are many with a sincere belief that Tesla cannot persist and prosper. Like most people here, I think they're wrong to believe that, but that's not really the point here.

Stuff like labour practices and autopilot performance getting disproportionate attention I think can be explained without any agenda, but simply because the interest in Tesla is bigger, and the ethical company profile attracts more scrutiny. "
7fe0my,dqbd7kj,"Once the model 3 line is up and humming, there will be no stopping Tesla. Up until then, they're still in a mildly precarious state. And I can't see any major issues coming up between now and 6+ months from now when they achieve that. Haters gonna hate."
7fe0my,dqc1ozf,"Remember how Amazon was going to fail, they don‚Äôt make a profit and Jeff Bezos doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs doing? SpaceX was looked at the same way, until they upend an industry. The legacy companies resist change and see it as something that has to fail, because it‚Äôs different than how they do things and the way they do things has to be the right way because it‚Äôs how they‚Äôve always been done. It‚Äôs also why these innovators succeed and do it in such a dominant way, because the old guard would rather die off than change. And when they finally realize that the world has changed around them, they do their best to try and catch up, if they succeed, they end up being at best a shell of their former selves. General Motors will go the way of Kodak, they invented the modern electric car with the EV-1 and failed to see it as the future, just as Kodak invented the digital camera and ignored what it would become. Elon Musk will probably be the richest person in the world one day, and people will still call him a fraud and say that he doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs doing, some people just oppose change. "

The amount of work it takes just to get to a baseline of reality so you can have some sort of rational discussion has become all but impossible in here anymore.  You have to argue against 10 false narratives before you even get to whatever the thread happens to be about.

Honestly, this whole ""us vs them"" narrative is one of the most tiring.  I know it gets you all fired up and is a great rallying cry, but from the outside it makes the Tesla fanboys look nutty and all it accomplishes is shutting down any rational discourse.  You all have fostered an environment where any criticism is now simply shouted down with accusations of FUD, shills, shorts, and now paid lobbyists from PR companies.  The comparison of Tesla fans to religious fanatics?  This is where that comes from.

Elon called it out this is just to prove a point once and for all.  I feel like he read the articles and was like wow ok I will shut them down. 

Though jalp did a post about roaster 2.0 with sources from a battery designer who laughed at them and was like not only does a 200k pack make sense for the current draw but it may very well out last a 100k pack due to discharge requirements under normal wear mode.

As with most things, there isn't really a yes or no answer to that.  Tesla is scaling back production because they have too much inventory on hand.  They say they're beyond their sales targets, skeptics will point out their sales are way below other midsize luxury sedans and they guided for higher volumes last year.

Fear, uncertainty and doubt (often shortened to FUD) is a disinformation strategy used in sales, marketing, public relations, talk radio, politics, religious organizations, and propaganda. FUD is generally a strategy to influence perception by disseminating negative and dubious or false information and a manifestation of the appeal to fear.

While the phrase dates to at least the early 20th century, the present common usage of disinformation related to software, hardware and technology industries generally appeared in the 1970s to describe disinformation in the computer hardware industry, and has since been used more broadly.

7fe0my,dqbjurn,"This is vastly underestimating the (overall beneficial) disruption a company like Tesla, and in particularly,  self driving cars is going to bring.  Take your conclusions further and you realize the day is rapidly coming when all the truckers, cab drivers, ship captains, delivery drivers and pilots will be replaced with self driving vehicles, and that is only the first and most obvious losers in the coming wave of SDC (self-driving cars)

 ‚Ä¢ Insurance companies will need fewer agents and claims handlers. There are going to be way fewer accidents and way fewer cars period. 

 ‚Ä¢ Less demand for medical personnel. Injuries from vehicular accidents are billions of dollars and tens of thousands of lives every year. We're talking about near complete elimination of those accidents. There were literally over 2 million Americans injured from vehicle accidents in 2010 and again in 2013. 

 ‚Ä¢ Gas demand will plummet. If electric vehicles don't kill gas stations then SDC will drastically reduce their necessity. SDC will be able to save billions of dollars in fuel by routing all cars more efficiently so we waste less time in traffic. They'll also just drive more efficiently. Human drivers waste fuel in how they drive. SDC will be able to manage that better saving fuel lowering fuel demand across the board.

 ‚Ä¢ Not just cab drivers but Uber/Lyft drivers as well. I dunno about you guys but living in a city, it seems like there's thousands of them. Many of them doing it as a full-time job.

 ‚Ä¢ Police forces will be reduced. How many cops are out there trying to catch speeders or writing people up for parking tickets? In a world of SDC, neither of those things are going to happen. SDC will obey all parking and traffic laws to the letter. You can also start writing off the judges and other clerks and staff associated with traffic courts.

 ‚Ä¢ Car companies will be making fewer cars because there will be less demand. People in cities already often forego owning a car. We have carshares, bikeshares, and public/private transportation. When you could call an SDC as easily as calling for an Uber/Lyft and have it take you anywhere that only further reduces the desire for a personal car. And then after dropping you off that car could either go park itself or just go off to find the next passenger. 

 ‚Ä¢ Car dealerships. Fewer people wanting cars doesn't just mean fewer cars manufactured but fewer cars being bought at dealers. 

 ‚Ä¢ Auto mechanics. Fewer accidents, fewer need for repairs. 

 ‚Ä¢ Car parts manufacturers. Way reduced demand for parts. Not only are there fewer cars being built but there's fewer accidents so less need for replacements. 

Basically anything that uses vehicles or has vehicles anywhere in their business model is going to see big big changes.

Nevermind the lack of credentials or relevant scientific standing of those denying man made climate change, as long as someone on TV says it, my ignorant opinion is as valid as yours because feelings.

It's a multi trillion dollar industry and who knows how many people and family members are concerned globally about the change from fossil fuels to renewables and from ICE cars to EVs. That's before we even get to AI replacing them at work. Frankly autopilot is not ready now, nobody has a level 4 system that works in any condition, it's still years away, but the technology for renewables and EVs is ready now, it's just a matter of decreasing costs and iterating with small improvements. The first iPhone was kind of shit to what smartphones we have today but we got to where we are through the same process. It's not really comparable imo in terms of how many would be troubled between the industries affected, though I understand why truckers specifically would feel threatened by Tesla's self driving technology. Still it's drops in the ocean compared with the vast web weaved by fossil fuels.

Also, Tesla said in their investor call that they haven't even ordered the equipment to complete the production ramp (likely because it would strain their cash flow further while they nail down the manufacturing process).  Therefore, unless Tesla gets several thousand model 3 a week rolling out the door in the next few months, they will have to raise more money, likely with unfavorable terms.

In any case, Tesla has changed the conversation about EVs. Sure, they're leading the charge against ICE cars but a ton of manufacturers are now moving towards making EVs.

That sounds like a very rational position today given where we are with the Model 3 but just a few months ago it didn't exist and Tesla was still the most shorted stock of all time. So it's not that.

The reason why Tesla is shorted is irrelevant to my point. It's that individuals who have shorted Tesla are highly, highly motivated to push bad PR around."

This comment kind of irritates me because it‚Äôs not like this wasn‚Äôt *planned*. Everyone that reserved a Model 3 knew going in it would be months before actually getting their hands on it. 

Tesla does not have a production scalability problem, they are actively ramping up production as fast as possible. It‚Äôs not *just* up to Tesla to produce cars, it‚Äôs up to their suppliers as well. The majority of slowness is coming from the suppliers, coming from the *plan*, not Tesla themselves (except their Gigafactory, that‚Äôs another bottleneck). 

One more time: this slowness/ramp up phase was *planned*, it takes time to reach proper mass production levels, and everyone knew how long it‚Äôd take. If they didn‚Äôt, they didn‚Äôt do enough research because Elon himself said it would be a while. "

7fe0my,dqbi0dv,"Alright, point taken, it can be a viable strategy for threatened industries, where every day they delay progress is another dollar. What I had in mind in my comments was mainly about short sellers who are also often accused. To them, delaying progress doesn't help, only the sell and buy price matters. 

If they wanted to get out they could reduce their losses by closing during a dip they create, but that doesn't seem to be the case. If anything they double down on the dips because they take it as a sign that they're right and that it's the beginning of the end for Tesla. 

My assessment is that there's a bunch of wall street types who genuinely were convinced that Tesla will collapse and that shorting Tesla would be easy money. Having been burned so badly their view of Tesla has become emotionally charged, and that's why they're making these over-the-top anti-tesla statements.

7fe0my,dqcpvhe,"Good lord.  Do you even listen to yourself?  But I'll address your points one by one.

1. Only about 27% of the voting population voted for Trump.  Never forget that.  That means that a whopping ***73%*** of voting age Americans didn't vote for Trump.
1a. Not voting for Clinton was not equivalent to voting for Trump.  You could say the exact opposite and it would be just as true (I.E. false).  It's also the responsibility of a candidate to garner votes; no candidate ""deserves"" to be elected.  That's how democracy works.
2. Media outlets magnify minority viewpoints.  That goes for both sides of the isle.  You should see some of the (factual) stories the right gets that you've probably never read.  The Wall Street Journal has a great site that demonstrates this - link at the end.
3. Corrupt?  Both parties are pretty damn corrupt.  Arguing that one of them is more corrupt than the other is laughable.  The Clinton foundation is probably the single most corrupt entity on planet Earth.  Trump is just as bad.
4. Plenty of Republicans are decent people.  Unlike the Democrats, the Republicans have an open primary; which means anyone can run and win (instead of, you know, political elites preselecting their preferred candidate and then campaigning against the other one like the DNC.).  Unfortunately, democracy being what it is, you don't always get the best result when you allow an open primary.
5. Wake up and smell reality.  The Republicans control ***literally*** every level of goverment.  State legislatures, governorships, the House, the Senate, the Supreme Court, and the Presidency.  That wave hit Britain, and it's hitting Germany now (Merkel failed to organize a government).  The Democrats currently have an identity crisis, and a message that has failed to resonate.  Seriously, 60% of voting Americans lean liberal, there are no excuses for losing an election.


I'm not a Republican, I'm independent.  Both parties suck large sweaty balls, both have complete lunatics on the fringe, and both are run by people who are wholly incompetent and corrupt to the core.  Most Americans, however, are perfectly decent people.  I'd suggest talking to some of them in real life, you might find they're not as bad as you think.

I would think the number of people who drive pickups for utilitarian purposes far outnumber the ones who roll coal and hang balls on the back and probably never tow or haul anything with it.  It will be in high demand.

That's the problem though, sadly. They actually did assert fair use by having it clearly written at the top of the description, and I think I remember there being an annotation as well. I remember it specifically because I was shocked when YouTube / RCA Records took it down, after all Cinesaurus had done to make the fair use clear. I get the feeling they just decided YouTube can fuck off based on principle when their appeal most likely got denied (YouTube is notorious for this).

I guess I wouldn't have minded as much if the uploader of this version had put at least any mention of the creators. Didn't even mention [Cinesaurus](http://cinesaurus.com/) in the title, nor did they put any information at all in the description. Cinesaurus put a lot of work into this video assumedly as a promotional bit, and now the only mention we get of them is their name for two seconds at the outro.

1d0d8kr,l5mxe7x,"God the Tesla stop thing is insane. It's so incredibly slow and waits forever, if I didn't tap the pedal to make it go I know I'd totally annoy the guy behind me."
1d0d8kr,l5n65dg,"Good point. far enough in the future people will probably just act like they are on a train, not trying to be a backseat driver. Esp when all cars are automatic and legislators can potentially increase the speed limits.

It's the short-term future where I worry about an uncanny valley of frustrated FSD ""supervisors"" blocking adoption."
1d0d8kr,l5ni7mp,"Yeah I mean it makes so little difference for so many drives really.

A 20 minute drive at 35mph is like 17 minutes at 40mph. That's noise. Catching one light or not.

If you were watching shit on YouTube you wouldn't give the speed limit a second thought."
1d0d8kr,l5mdkv1,"""Guidelines"" which are enforced by the police and carry fines and loss of your driving license are not guidelines. They are laws, and it's not clear why society should allow autonomous systems to ignore them.

The correct answer is to update laws as appropriate, both for humans and computers. Nothing that says we can't have a law that says speed limits only apply to human drivers."
1d0d8kr,l5n5hcc,You're still in the car and responsible for it though.
1d0d8kr,l5n5nqj,Oh - for me it always seems to drop down pretty suddenly to the new speed limit. But I haven't been on highways much yet with 12.3.6
1d0d8kr,l5nmtnz,"Mine suddenly decelerates hard by 10-15mph when it goes from 70 to 55, even if traffic is moving the same speed. It‚Äôs annoying because there are Work Zone signs for 55 but it‚Äôs MDW so no one is actually working there."
1d0d8kr,l5n1jjq,"The required conditions include:

The functionality must be enabled within the FSD Beta Profile settings; and

The vehicle must be approaching an all-way stop intersection; and

The vehicle must be traveling below 5.6 mph; and

No relevant moving cars are detected near the intersection; and

No relevant pedestrians or bicyclists are detected near the intersection; and

There is sufficient visibility for the vehicle while approaching the intersection; and

All roads entering the intersection have a speed limit of 30 mph or less."
1d0d8kr,l5n5cuj,From my experience FSD doesn't go over the posted limit unless the user manually dials up the max speed.
1d0d8kr,l5n8qlv,"Yes, you are correct. But the issue is that in USA and Canada a stop sign is placed where a YIELD sign should be used. Same issue with the speed signs. Nobody goes the speed limit not because they are in a hurry, but because the signeage is wrong most of the time and not dynamically adjusted."
1d0d8kr,l5myrbw,Or people could stop being so fuckin impatient we‚Äôd have less accidents
1d0d8kr,l5nh647,FSD suggests no liability for you. Who pays for the accident?
1d0d8kr,l5nvckf,"Speed limits themselves will be completely revamped. Once every car is self driving, and safety & reliability of that safety goes way up, speed limits will change to better facilitate the flow of traffic. The real problem will be congestion. The already congested dense urban areas will see that congestion go way up. But there are so many steps between now and then ift's mostly just a thought experiement at this point."
1d0d8kr,l5mp053,"Regarding updating laws - yes this is the core of what I'm wondering. I.e. if Tesla is working with legislators/regulators to break out of the current FSD behavior of following speed limits (unless user dials up max speed every time the limit changes). I haven't heard anyone discuss this issue. 

There are also times when FSD 12.3.6 stays too close to the max speed setting when it should be slowing down, eg when approaching a tight turn. But it's getting better at that already and it's a relatively easy problem to solve. I do wonder what will be the future functionality of the max-speed dial on the wheel/yoke."
1d0d8kr,l5n6baa,Well if it's safer to travel with the flow of traffic than it is to slam on your brakes they might rethink that.  That's kind of how we got the software the way it is now. It was safer to maintain with the flow of traffic and then do what the sign said.
1d0d8kr,l5n647n,"Mine's been doing it for a while not sure where it kicked in. I think I actually had it on version 11, but I'm not 100% sure. It's easy to tell you're in that state because the max speed limit is now in blue instead of black letting you know that it's being overridden by the keeping up with traffic safety thing."
1d0d8kr,l5n5uob,"> No relevant moving cars are detected near the intersection

I've seen FSD mis-identify pedestrians more than once.

Sorry, but there's simply no justification for ""rolling stops"". It's just a blatantly unsafe feature, that should have never been even added."
1d0d8kr,l5nhzbd,"Highway is offset based

FSD you can set it to auto where you can‚Äôt set max speed anymore and it most definitely does go over max speed because their is none it chooses its own based on traffic and speed limit on road

Maybe you don‚Äôt have that enabled it‚Äôs a rather new setting"
1d0d8kr,l5nfyro,"No, STOP signs are placed to make sure drivers pay attention to cross-streets.

Speed limit signs are kinda designed with expectations that people will speed a little bit in practice. This will probably be fixed eventually, once self-driving cars become more wide-spread."
1d0d8kr,l5na3qj,Nah gtfo the way!
1d0d8kr,l5nvu2h,"Tesla is in a weird place right now, because they'll want to put off liability as long as possible (thus ""beta"" and ""supervised."" But they're pushing as hard as possible to get to robotaxi level autonomy and once they do, they'll have to accept liability. It's the driver that's responsible, so if the car's driving, then the makers of that software/hardware will need to accept liability. There's no way around that."
1d0d8kr,l5n4dp5,"In most states that have any kind of autonomy laws. the owner of the vehicle is liable for any laws broken. That's you.

That only applies for full L3/L4 autonomy. We're at L2 with current FSD. There is no question here that the driver is fully responsible for monitoring the system and following all laws. It's silly to think that a L2 system should be allowed a different set of laws."
1d0d8kr,l5n9iqk,They still have to drive within the limits of the law.
1d0d8kr,l5n6i9p,"Oh then this seems to solidly answer my question, implying that tesla is already breaking the speed limit fully automatically."
1d0d8kr,l5n79it,"I am not taking a side on this issue. I am just pointing out that NHTSA did, and they likely will side on strict adherence to the law for speeding.

I think we both agree that speeding is a much bigger contributor to collisions and especially fatal collisions than rolling stop. 


-

There absolutely is justification (just listing, not defending) The main justification is to ""drive predictably"". People cause accidents driving legally but not predictable. The goal needs to be minimal accidents/fatalities. 

We don't know if a single accident ever happened with that feature, and we didn't know if it's ""blatantly unsafe"".

If the absence of the feature triggers people to override the stop it might cause more accidents.

People also break traffic rules all the time for overall better outcomes. Crossing double yellows for example when the single lane is blocked.

I take it you always stop at least 3 seconds at stop signs (and right turn on red) and you never were 1 mph above the speed limit.  And no jay walking either.

And you turned the rolling stop feature off while it was available, yes?"
1d0d8kr,l5ni1oo,"Highway is offset based on max setting you set

FSD non-highway you can set it to auto where you can‚Äôt set max speed anymore and it most definitely does go over max speed because their is none it chooses its own based on traffic and speed limit on road

Maybe you don‚Äôt have that enabled it‚Äôs a rather new setting

I imagine highway will get the same new auto offset once it moves to the new networks"
1d0d8kr,l5nhzox,"Yes, I understand why you would think that. However, my reference was to the reason most drivers roll through, and the answer is still the same. Most STOP signs are placed where they don't belong, such as 4 way stops. It really would help me explain it better if I knew if you ever travel to Europe or not."
1d0d8kr,l5p0p9s,"People don‚Äôt know how to use yield signs and rarely obey stop signs in low populated areas. ¬†I work for the railroad and every crossing incident I‚Äôve been personally witness to is people failing to properly yield. ¬†The sign shouldn‚Äôt exist at crossings and intersections. ¬†I could see its use when merging, but we‚Äôre supposed to do that anyway.¬†

Yield is a useless piece of signage.¬†"
1d0d8kr,l5nrr2u,You make a good point. Who is responsible if your cyber taxi rear-ends a car while it's out and about?
1d0d8kr,l5n9ufw,I vote for being alive and not following the law versus following the law and being dead because that's what happens here.
1d0d8kr,l5n6rq2,Yeah it surprised me when it happened because it's a place where I always knew I had to spend the knob to get the speed back up to not get rear-ended.
1d0d8kr,l5ngl0v,"> I think we both agree that speeding is a much bigger contributor to collisions and especially fatal collisions than rolling stop. 

The thing is, stop sign violations are a pretty large contributor too:

> In addition, the NHTSA reports that an average of 38 percent of the fatal intersection crashes that take place each year involve intersections that are controlled by a stop sign. 

Additionally, even ""safe"" rolling stops normalize risky behavior. This is just an extremely bad idea, as we know from safety engineering."
1d0d8kr,l5nmlxw,"I grew up in Europe :)

I actually like STOP signs in the US, they make intersections much easier to navigate."
1d0d8kr,l5nd75y,There are no stats to back up what you're saying. It's also not up for a vote.
1d0d8kr,l5ny360,I'll vote with my life thank you. There's an accident literally every freaking day on that road cuz somebody slams on their brakes to slow down and gets rear-ended.
1d0d8kr,l5nyxo2,Slowing from 65 to 55 doesn't require slamming on the brakes.
1d0d8kr,l5o9o47,Yet people get rear-ended their almost every single day.  I guess when you were doing 65 and you come up on a car doing 55 that you didn't notice try not slamming on your brakes and see how that works for you.

1bh93fs,kvcbreq,"Put where you‚Äôre going in your nav and start to drive there. Push down on your shifter twice and it will take over. Keep your hands close to the wheel as it will have you apply pressure here and there during the ride. 

Be prepared to take over by braking or turning the wheel a bit and you will hear an audible ‚Äúding‚Äù when it is cancelled and you are taking over. It will auto set the speed to the speed limit, so if you want it to go faster, scroll the right steering wheel toggle up. Good luck."
1bh93fs,kvcfob3,For me personally I like to do single pull so essentially it skips TACC. FSD profile it depends on the situation but usually I jumped between chill and average. The really main difference is following distance for that and lane change occurrence. Lane change notification I just have it set on Chime so it'll make a noise before it changes the lane but usually it will make the chime in the middle of changing lane.
1bh93fs,kvce5xj,"Once you activate it, I read to just rest your left hand on the steering wheel and your arm on the door armrest. I have since reading that and noticed a near nagless FSD with navigation."
1bh93fs,kvd000s,"Okay, start out simple.get on a straight road and start FSD by pulling down twice. Do this for a couple of days. Then get in the city and only go straight but go thru stop signs and stop lights. After a couple of days of this tour, all set. Keep your hands close and ready. In a month, you'll feel how comfortable it is.
Remember... this is BETA software, meaning it can and will mess up be ready."

It took me awhile to relax and realize that yes, it WILL make this turn coming up.  Some aspects of FSD are better than others. The lane keeping seems really solid (at least where I live).

16nx97d,k1i0wxv,Boggles my mind that I have to set this on every drive. No good reason for it. The unnecessary lane changes are the second worst thing about FSD.
16nx97d,k1jtk7p,The insane stupidity of the lane change behavior should definitely make minimal the default until they pull their heads out of their asses
16nx97d,k1iawot,And why does it reset every time?
16nx97d,k1kb9eo,"*looks around nervously*

Am I the only person who doesn't turn it on?"
16nx97d,k1k3kzh,"there should also be a setting for ""limit use of highways.""

i live near a highway entrance and for almost every inter-city drive, nav wants me to take the highway."
16nx97d,k1hgfyo,Because it would be bad if the system didn't pass slow cars.
16nx97d,k1kz3pn,"I am 5 years now with Tesla.  With all the great features we have now, lane change has become more of a problem then fantom braking.  We should be able to disable ANY lane changes if we prefer it.  I get that FSD needs auto lane changes but only if the driver wants it on.  Tesla has given us so much customization it is wonderful.  But lane changing should be up to the driver and it can be toggled on if I have faith in it or turned off if not or if I am still learning.  What's the big deal asking for a toggle."
16nx97d,k1jqh5o,Complete agree and it also should remember your last setting.  Absolutely can‚Äôt stand the way FSD operates with it on.  Huge step backwards to the way it was before and dangerous.
16nx97d,k1uxpe1,I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs because Tesla wants more training data for lane changes so they‚Äôre forcing you to be a guinea pig.
16nx97d,k1hr6pz,"So sitting in traffic today it wanted to change lanes several times. I was in the center lane for a reason. I didn't need to move to the left lane because in <2 miles I'd be exiting. AND IT KNEW THAT!  But as I crept along it tried to move to the left 4 times to a lane that 1) was on the wrong side, and 2) was only slightly faster. I would have moved and within 1/2 mile to a mile it would need to move TWO lanes in order to exit. The AI there failed in my opinion."
16nx97d,k1i1e2s,"Did it say ""changing to faster lane"" or ""changing lanes to follow route""?

Regardless, minimal lane changes being default is not the solution. Better lane change logic is the solution. Minimal lane changes being on by default would be horrible. Goes against the entire point of FSD, because it would force you to make manual lane changes. People would just complain and ask why their FSD is stuck in a single lane and doesn't move."
16nx97d,k1i2gtf,"It was the former but there was no logic in this case. As I said, I was getting off the highway in less than 2 miles. There was no legit reason to get into the left lane when it would then want to get back to the right, then right again in order to exit."
16nx97d,k1i82qe,How about someone at the company think about customer experience and allow not yet fine tuned behavior be turned off until properly QA'ed.
16nx97d,k1iif35,"I agree. But the solution is better reasoning, not disabling those lane changes all together. That's just replacing one problem with another."
16nx97d,k1izb32,Fsd can‚Äôt tailor to everyone‚Äôs driving ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø live with it
16nx97d,k1iimww,"Like I said, if they did that, people would just whine about FSD not changing lanes when it should."
16nx97d,k1jsnws,Agreed!
16nx97d,k1lcw8l,The solution is give the driver what he wants.

1bhbjn1,kvcyyye,"So can someone with v12 explain to me what happens now if I accidentally put too much pressure on the steering wheel and the car drops out of FSD? 

My car on v 11.9 today: Car happily changes into the cruise control and I have the wheel. 

My worry about v12: Does the car end all autopilot functions, and therefore suddenly and unexpectedly hard-decelerate because a foot isn't on the pedal?? This sounds like a nightmare."
1bhbjn1,kvfhtfp,What about the trailer mode? Does it disable FSD completely? No traffic-aware cruise control after single pull any more?

1bhbjn1,kvd68z9,"Correct, TACC isn't a thing anymore. You are in full control of the car.

You can test this by turning on single pull mode."
1bhbjn1,kxwgwjc,"Honestly, this is the first time I wish I could downgrade.  AP still isn't good enough for all situations, despite all of the rave reviews, and now I don't have the ability to choose AP or tac over the same drive."
1bhbjn1,kvdayqm,This seems like the worst idea from Tesla. Now any accidental disengagement or forced disengagement because the car was doing something stupid will leave people scrambling to push the accelerator with just the right amount of pressure or they are going to look like a crazy driver.
1bhbjn1,kvf4mnr,"This is exactly why I don‚Äôt use this mode. I don‚Äôt have FSD, so the easiest way to change lanes in autopilot is to put on my blinker, turn the wheels out of AP so that I‚Äôm still in TACC to maintain speed, and then reengage AP in the new lane. With single pull I have to take over speed control in the interim and it‚Äôs much more clunky."
1bhbjn1,kveeqgo,This was forced by the NHTSA. They complained that people were confused when auto steer was disabled but TACC was not.
1bhbjn1,kve8bxz,"It‚Äôs not that hard to press the accelerator.  Like, seriously, have you never taken over from regular cruise control in a regular car before?  It‚Äôs no different."
1bhbjn1,kvdb4gk,"It is the way I prefer to have things. Either I am in control or the car is in control. No middle grounds.

If FSD fucked up to the extent that I needed to take over, I don't trust TACC to be competent at that moment either. The two are being fed the same data and governed by similar code. FSD already did something to make me look like a crazy driver. It is a bit late to be worrying about that."
1bhbjn1,kxwevx1,"It still results in a moment or two of deceleration before you manage to press the accelerator, and most likely jerk your passengers around a bit finding the right position.  If the NHTSA was concerned about mistaking TAC for AP, then they should have revised the UI to make it blatantly clear which mode the car is in.  Not just take one mode away if the other is available.  More than just a blue line on the rendered vehicle view."
1bhbjn1,kxwgfl2,"> It is the way I prefer to have things. Either I am in control or the car is in control. No middle grounds.

To each their own.  I strongly prefer to have the freedom to choose TAC in some situations and AP in others, but now I'm forced to choose which I want before starting the drive.  And if I want to change I have to pull over and stop.  Honestly, this is probably going to cause me to use AP far less because TAC is frankly usable in more situations, and AP is still not that great despite all the raving about v12."

106tec2,j3kxpmj,The big one to watch out for is if you even glance at an phone you are holding in view of the in-cabin camera.  Immediate strike - no warning.
106tec2,j4qudlm,"Here is the latest:

https://www.notateslaapp.com/news/1154/tesla-is-resetting-fsd-beta-strikes-with-beta-10-69-25-2"
106tec2,j3jc4x7,"You sure it wasn't because you were near cones?

Cones trigger an instant ""Hands on the wheel asshole!"" Alert"
106tec2,j4rrhzy,Great.  Looking forward to leaving jail soon!
106tec2,j4sd9tv,How do they know about the reset. I don‚Äôt see it on the release notes or anywhere else.
106tec2,j3ji5p0,But not a strike until it‚Äôs a repeating offense.
106tec2,j3jjmmv,"Correct.

I got *a lot* of ""Pay attention"" alerts for either messing with the center console screen too often, or using my phone, or a variety of things, but never did I let it get escalated to a strike. 

I look at the center console screen for a bit, rhen put my eyes on the road for 2-3 seconds, where I know the cabin camera can see me, then go back to the center console screen. 

As long as you're putting eyes on the road regularly, the car really doesn't care.

And I *really* relied on Autopilot/FSD Beta on some stretches because the lines on the road were so poorly marked that I legitimately could not see them without the car handling it for me.

No strikes, just warnings."
128wvki,jekwttk,"that is by design, part of the recall 'fix'."
128wvki,jeksgqt,"You had Beta for so long but you haven't heard about these changes?

Yes. These things have been changed at the request of the NHTSA, among other things, which you will discover."
128wvki,jeks3u4,"Yep.  You can only set a percentage, not an actual speed number.  No one knows why yet.  The assumption is it‚Äôs due to the NHSA"
128wvki,jenf6dh,"Thanks for responses, everyone. Pointed me in the right direction.

After looking it up, the reason I didn't see it in the notes is because it's not in the release notes for the 2022.45.13 update, but instead in the OTA recall update notes, which was done at the same time for me? Not used to seeing multiple releases at the same time.

For anyone wondering, in the OTA release notes, it reads as:

""3. Improved the Tesla's speed adjustment when entering certain speed zones by allowing for earlier control for detected speed limit signs. The assertiveness of the response when slowing down for detected speed limit signs is determined by the current speed and its difference to the speed indicated by the detected sign. Added a visual glow behind the speed limit icon on the user-interface to alert the driver when the vehicle's set speed exceeds the detected speed limit by more than 50%. Finally, the option for an absolute Speed Limit offset in FSD Beta was removed; only the percent-based offset will be available.""

I'd have thought it warranted its own number since it seems like a big change many will notice as opposed to an afterthought on the end of large paragraph ü§∑üèª"
128wvki,jem71xh,Maybe read the release notes?
128wvki,jel20mc,Yeah I've had the beta from the beginning but around a year ago I gave up on reading every little change that they announced. There's just too many to keep up with anymore. Most of them as discovered by experience now.
128wvki,jektgkv,That's not an assumption. It's specifically listed as part of the recall-related changes.
128wvki,jendpqv,"I scan through them quickly when updates are first done, but some of the updates have been so lengthy and technical that it's like reading lines of code. 

Guess the part that confused me the most was how Tesla's always been good about putting info or something about why options may not be available in the info icon when you click it and I didn't see anything this time around.

I'll give them a closer look here. Thanks."
1289h4e,jehw77k,"I got it on MYLR no uss, was on 2022.44.30.10   fsd 10.69.25.2"
1289h4e,jehwtei,"Sounds like this might have minor bug fixes, but mostly a v11 update to include non-USS cars.

https://twitter.com/teslascope/status/1642009225726668800?s=46&t=xkuvUAX2eB-Go2bm2mmzUw"
1289h4e,jehzpcv,"This just finished installing for me, can confirm I got 11.3.5"
1289h4e,jehw7kg,My car is downloading 2022.45.14. Only .13 is listed in teslifi. Anyone else have .14?  Is that the one with .5 beta?
1289h4e,jehwsd9,"It‚Äôs being rolled out to new testers. I just got Beta for the first time, coming from a factory build."
1289h4e,jei8oe9,I got it from v10. Immediately took it for a drive‚Ä¶and holy shit it‚Äôs a huge improvement. Everything is smoother and there‚Äôs virtually no ping ponging that I always used to get.
1289h4e,jehv4gn,11.3.3 had many issues for me both on highway and on the street. I hope theyy fix it. Specially aggressive lane change and following distance on highway.
1289h4e,jehw20j,Just got it
1289h4e,jehw4l2,"I just got this update too. Of note, I got my M3P after the ‚Äúrecall‚Äù and never had FSD before. They must be letting people back in again"
1289h4e,jehwecs,Weird as they pushed 11.3.4 earlier today - my first v11 build from 2022.44.30.10. I wonder what changed that quickly?
1289h4e,jeisg3x,Just got this this morning as well. Model 3 RWD without USS.
1289h4e,jei3224,"Sure, why not? The ship cycle for bug fixes are often shorter than the rollout cycle - they‚Äôve already shown no fear in canning unproductive rollouts early.  This will keep going until existing and newly discovered P0‚Äôs are eradicated in the narrow group, whence it‚Äôll go wider again, rinse repeat."
1289h4e,jeidd8n,"As a software engineer this is extremely sloppy. Releasing builds this fast to the public is pretty scary actually. Seems like there's no QA or any code reviews done. Just someone merging to prod with an eh not my problem, I did my code quota for the month."
1289h4e,jeiiubz,I got 11.3.4 but now the Tesla app won‚Äôt connect to the car. Updated the app and signed in/out but nothing. I wonder if 11.3.5 has something to do with this issue.
1289h4e,jeismt9,I have a M3LR and have been on FSD beta since they first introduced safety scores. I still haven‚Äôt gotten any v11 updates and am on 2022.44.30.10. Any idea why I‚Äôm not getting updates?
1289h4e,jeivqxh,I got 11.3.4 last night
1289h4e,jej8xwi,"Does your car have to be connected to wifi to get pinged it's available to be updated? If my car is only on cellular, will it notify me there's an update available? I've been waiting for fsd for a few weeks now."
1289h4e,jejdp15,call me when it hits the 2023 branch :D
1289h4e,jejr9su,"I received my model 3 performance (with no uss) update last week. Call me crazy but driving for 3 days now, I think the vision only is very accurate. I like having the side visualation that I never had on cars I've owned with uss before."
1289h4e,jejy7xi,"Yeah check notateslaapp website. I'm on 11.3.4 
Hoping to get the 11.3.5 this weekend."
1289h4e,jekgf6d,Yep got 11.3.5 this morning on our 23 MYLR
1289h4e,jekrxj6,i got .5 last night. Tested this morning. Not the huge improvement I was hoping for over 10.69. <sigh>
1289h4e,jel0gkw,Yup
1289h4e,jehwaq2,Maybe they forgot to include some bug fixes on 11.3.4 today lol
1289h4e,jeiyuol,So does this update eliminate the use of USS on cars that have it? I can‚Äôt tell. Certainly the onscreen graphics associated with USS are gone but is there any way to tell if they are disabled?
1289h4e,jej7rgj,Just downloaded
1289h4e,jehxmbl,Does 2022.45.14 include the beta? I am on the 2022.44.30.10. And got the update but no idea if it includes the beta v11
1289h4e,jejeu12,"How were you on a 2022 branch before?  I don‚Äôt think you can get it once you have a 2023, which almost all non-beta cars have."
1289h4e,jeijrec,It seems insane how much of an improvement this is. Feels very human now. Freeway driving is properly assertive now. It feels super confident.
1289h4e,jejfarh,Do you have it on assertive?
1289h4e,jei0h0e,What is your factory version?
1289h4e,jeiejpj,"I heard that the .5 version is for the newer cars without USS. If so it was planned, not a knee jerk release."
1289h4e,jej2veg,My app is fine on my 11.3.4 car and my 10.69 car.
1289h4e,jej2xsl,My Y is this way. My 3 got 11.3.2/3/4. No rhyme or reason. The 3 is older.
1289h4e,jehxgu8,Does it include fsd beta v11? I am on the 2022.44.30.10 but i don‚Äôt want to lose my beta software
1289h4e,jej2pwk,"Before you jump to conclusions, we need to confirm that this was installed on a USS car and that the visualization changes. I haven‚Äôt seen proof of that scenario yet."
1289h4e,jej84uu,Only difference is this is for vehicles w/o USS.  I just downloaded it and finally have park assist back!
1289h4e,jehxqjk,"It does, check the release notes."
1289h4e,jek3e1x,"I got the car delivered and requested beta, so I didn‚Äôt receive any updates until beta became available"
1289h4e,jei1ggx,The car came with 2022.44.100
1289h4e,jejx1st,Glad it‚Äôs working for you. This could be a bug which only affects some people under certain conditions and/or is timing related. Putting it out here in case anyone else hit it
1289h4e,jejxa5z,Even apps like stats can‚Äôt connect to the car via the API. Car is drivable and works but they hosed something
1289h4e,jej5ntv,Got it. Thanks üôè
1289h4e,jek1m22,Yes.
1289h4e,jej3okn,Oh I have it on mine. The visualization on the highway when you come close to a car and you see the arc beams radiate toward the other car. That is gone.
1289h4e,jei7mxk,when did you get the delivery? Like December?
1289h4e,jejep11,"Holy crap that‚Äôs a weird version. 

I had some service done and they force upgraded 2023.2 when I had a 2022 branch before."
1289h4e,jekcxxf,"Has to be specific to your car. If you haven‚Äôt yet, open a Service request and they can re-push it remotely. There‚Äôs also an option to do it yourself in the in-car hidden service mode, but I‚Äôve never done it."
1289h4e,jej4cjn,Did you come from 10.69? Those disappeared with 11.3.2 (and I assume .1 but I didn‚Äôt have it). It‚Äôs not a USS thing.
1289h4e,jeid0yg,Ordered mid January and took delivery mid February
1289h4e,jek1rw8,This version seems to be running on a lot of the non-USS new deliveries. Def weird but they‚Äôve done this before.
1289h4e,jekdl28,It doesn‚Äôt HAVE to be specific to my car. It could just be a bug that affects x% of the fleet. In the interest of testing will see if I get 11.3.5 and the problem goes away.
1289h4e,jek1lzy,I went from 10.69 to 11.3.3. How do you know it isn‚Äôt a USS thing?
1289h4e,jeknepz,Yea some sort of bug on upgrade. It erased my driver profile from the car and won‚Äôt add / sync my Tesla cloud profile. Of course I can add a profile manually but can‚Äôt connect to cloud profile it says without the app (which does not work). Think my wife‚Äôs app works on the same app. Ugh
1289h4e,jekpejj,Ok it was acting funky in the car like it didn‚Äôt have Internet even when connected to WiFI. I reset the computer with both dials holding down. After reset WiFi works and the app worked again. Then my cloud profile magically showed up in the app again. Weird
1289h4e,jekcqv6,Because they disappeared in 11.3.2 and my normal USS interface works at slow speeds (eg in my garage).
1289h4e,jekqeep,That happened to me on a 10.69 version. App worked fine.
1289h4e,jelab3t,But it‚Äôs possible they eliminated it on highway. Just like they did radar. Really no way to know either way. Not sure I would be able to tell in the garage if it is using USS or only cameras.
1289h4e,jekqpqz,Yea I have had the profile erase before. This time it seems it erases profile and the onboard computer got in a weird state. LTE and networking maybe got messed up since the car was no longer API accessible?? Concerning. It might mean Tesla would lose access to the car and future updates fixing the issue could not be pushed without a computer reset most folks would not know about
1289h4e,jeljs9k,"In the garage it‚Äôs two completely different visualizations. I can tell you definitively that my USS car‚Äôs visualizations in my garage look like they have for the last four years, not like the ones in the vision based Park Assist. 

Summon also works, so the USS sensors are active."
1289h4e,jekt9mt,"If you read the manual, resetting the MCU and doing a power cycle are both there. 

Alas most people won‚Äôt read the manual so they don‚Äôt know how to use their highly sophisticated automobile. Can‚Äôt fix lazy."

149o7k4,jo6j3b9,It's going wide
149o7k4,jo6788x,Nothing new here (right?)
149o7k4,jo6l78w,Mine just installed but I didn't check it out. Is this the one that allows us to see all the cameras?
149o7k4,jo6rfcp,"Reading release notes always has me excited but then I have to manage my expectations since I was in FSD beta for so long. 11.3.6 was pretty good for me and I was excited to hear that 11.4.2 was going to address a lot of left hand turns and a few other things. Well, it tries to kill me almost daily now by attempting to swerve off a road out of nowhere when there‚Äôs a sharp turn and it thinks there might be a bicycle or a motorcycle coming across, tries to give me curb rash, doesn‚Äôt respect bike lanes, etc. Hoping this one is better."
149o7k4,jo8wlew,When will FSD Beta drivers get the new gear chime and customizable scroll wheel control features? I've been waiting on those for the past 3 software updates now :(
149o7k4,jo6i254,"Every update is a stress-inducing game of ‚Äúwhat will they fix and what were they break?‚Äù

11.4.1 was a great improvement, 11.4.2 is a regression in just about every way. Fingers crossed that this update takes what was good about 11.4.1 and improves upon it."
149o7k4,jo6lq1e,I thought people were getting 2023.12.10 now? Is that one not going wide? I‚Äôm on regular version 2023.12.9 and hoping I can get into beta this week
149o7k4,jo7xsfz,11.4.3 is so good for me now.  The ride has gotten so much more comfortable and it‚Äôs handling more complex situations with ease.  How‚Äôs it going for you guys?
149o7k4,joa7luo,Meanwhile in Europe: New fart sound added (Only available in Park)......
149o7k4,joabsmi,how does one get FSD beta. I have FSD but not the beta branch.
149o7k4,jobt8rx,haha beta not alpha haha
149o7k4,jodzrqy,I am sick of hearing about FSD beta updates and how it's getting so much better.  I only want to hear about it when it is ready for wide release.
149o7k4,jo6nysj,"Can confirm, am not in a special group and I got it tonight."
149o7k4,jo6jkdx,It did. It stopped. Im Still waiting. Hopefully another swath coming soon. They live putting new stuff out Friday and Saturday too!
149o7k4,jo6jshx,"Seriously, if I have it then it went wide well before today. I've been dealing with the beta since 10.x and I have always been at the end of the queue."
149o7k4,jo9wonf,I got it a couple of days ago...
149o7k4,jo69nz2,"After the update, my car can now make a mean half-half decaf with a twist of lime."
149o7k4,jo6cbk1,Updating later tonight.
149o7k4,jo7gks2,Nope this only an FSD beta update
149o7k4,jo6rcnj,11.4.3 works better for me. 11.4.2 was merging to turn lanes instead of going straight üò¨
149o7k4,jo7uu5h,11.4.2 breaks the wide roads fix that took them 2 years to fix it in V11. The car drives in the middle of the wide roads again while it was predicting yellow lines and it was driving on the right side
149o7k4,jo6jk54,"Everyone says it's a regression every time there is a new release. If this were a fact, we would be back to before it was ever released. The fact is that it just ends up sucking in a new way every time."
149o7k4,jo7i2fb,Got an update last night. 2023.12.11 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
149o7k4,jo6o73a,This is the FSD beta version. It‚Äôs always a few point releases behind. Non-FSD gets new features faster.
149o7k4,jo9s7py,Don‚Äôt sell yourself short. You‚Äôre special to us.
149o7k4,jo6a2p2,Well now I need this update
149o7k4,jo7acn4,Mine adds support for k-cups
149o7k4,jo8ib0l,Lime..in coffee? Is this a thing?
149o7k4,jo749ro,"11.4.2 did that for me too, just got 11.4.3, will test it out tomorrow"
149o7k4,jo7uffv,Can you elaborate? Most of my work commute is two lane roads with many short turn or passing lanes on the right. FSD often wants to get into these lanes and it‚Äôs highly annoying. Is this what you experienced that was fixed by 11.4.3? I‚Äôm hoping so!
149o7k4,joag4l9,Definitely not fixed in V11. I didn‚Äôt find 11.4.2 any worse on wide roads than any other releases. I‚Äôve been on 11.4.3 for a few days and it doesn‚Äôt seem much better either.
149o7k4,jo6jxb7,"I find generally it‚Äôs a two steps forward, one step back progression. They fix two things, break one."
149o7k4,jo8ra48,"I wonder how tesla determines which cars to push the update out to.  I'm still on 2023.12.100  
  
2023 MYP"
149o7k4,jo6tapc,2023.12.10 is a FSD beta version.
149o7k4,jo84krw,Wow! You must have Coffee 4 hardware.  You lucky sob ... I'm jealous.
149o7k4,jo8tkxw,Well I know Orange juice and coffee is pretty popular
149o7k4,jo84zf9,‚ÄúThus far‚Äù it works. But it didn‚Äôt always do the weird turn into the turn lane thing before.  It just hasn‚Äôt done it since the update ‚Ä¶ yet‚Ä¶üòÑ
149o7k4,jo6u8p5,"That‚Äôs not the current wide release FSD. It‚Äôs only FSD 11.3.6

11.4.x has only come in the 2023.7.x releases."
149o7k4,jo8bgf5,They need to just merge already.
vtfz83,if6y9ja,"Sometimes I‚Äôll hear a creaking-like noise when going over small bumps and turning at low speeds. Tbh it doesn‚Äôt bother me too much, but it does remind me that the build quality isn‚Äôt phenomenal. Could be plastic panels in the door rubbing against each other. Definitely don‚Äôt take ‚Äúno‚Äù for an answer at SC."
vtfz83,if73ens,You can try folding down the rear seats and slamming them back up.  I had a rattle after they replaced the rear window and that fixed it for me.
vtfz83,if7kr99,Like this? https://streamable.com/f7pkf6
vtfz83,if8au0d,"Yeah no, absolutely not acceptable for them to tell you to ""expect"" rattles on a new car. I have literally the exact same issue (the only delivery issue I found) and they took it for a test drive, confirmed it and I have an appointment set up for them to check it out and see what's causing it. 

I've had similar rattles on previous vehicles and it was usually something to do with the back seat not latching right or in the actual seat mounting."
vtfz83,ift0vm6,"UPDATE!!!

So I got sick and tired of the noise today. I looked up a video to disassemble the rear interior door. I took it apart and secured all of the wires within the door with foam. No more noises üòä

It sucks that I had to figure this out on my own and Tesla service was useless with the fix. Moving forward if I find any more rattles I‚Äôll just fix them myself"
vtfz83,ifcj1z4,"Could be the trim by the door next to the seat and seatbelt, try pressing on it so see if it rattles"
vtfz83,ifed6f4,So the service department wasn‚Äôt able to replicate the noise‚Ä¶. I even showed them video of the sound driving to the service center.
vtfz83,igkjzk6,Is the issue still resolved for you? I have had a rattle and clunking sound in mine which sounds very similar. Although mine can be heard at very low speeds and even on a smooth road. The SC has wrapped the strike bar where the rear passenger seat is and have ordered a new back for the rear seat at the passenger side. The rattle stopped for a while but has returned. I can see the felt tape has worn through on the strike bar and it‚Äôs worse if someone is sitting on the seat.
vtfz83,iivtdyh,I would insist they fix it otherwise I won't leave the SC if I were you. I went SC 5 times for rattle coming under the driver seat. They were patient and helpful and finally fixed the problem.
vtfz83,jxha1xq,"I have this too, it's actually one of 2 rattles I have, this particular one happens on the driver side window / door area. The SC lubricated internals and said it would ""settle down"" but hasn't yet and it's tedious as hell. In the process that have somehow also introduced another rattle on the back left side, it sounds like it's coming from the seat belt area of the rear passenger.   


I want Tesla to investigate it but at the same time I'm worried that by ""opening things up"" they'll just break something else in the process. Not great build quality I'm afraid"
vtfz83,if741dn,This is more than likely the issue. Where the seat ‚Äúclips‚Äù back into place can become loose causing noises when going over bumps. I‚Äôve read some people just put some electrical tape around the piece that goes into the latch and it seems to work.
vtfz83,if7mi7l,"I have been two times to the Service and the problem was not fixed. I tried also many fixes found here on Reddit (padding against the latches of the rear seats, padding between the seats and the trunk, etc) but I haven‚Äôt found a definite fix."
vtfz83,jhxj8ms,"I have the same issue on my 2021. They said it wasn‚Äôt fixable because it sounded like it came from the seatbelt‚Ä¶ which didn‚Äôt make sense but it did not sound like it.

Sound goes away when there‚Äôs someone sitting there or if I have a dog seat cover where there‚Äôs a handle that goes between the seat and the back rest"
vtfz83,j6bdbxt,What video did you use? I have the exact same rattle
vtfz83,k1kv8hm,Can you link to the video?
vtfz83,if86nxq,Yes that‚Äôs similar. What have they told you and why hasn‚Äôt it been able to be fixed by service?
vtfz83,jhxqlwt,I solved the issue by adding extra padding on the back of the seat
vtfz83,if86vvo,They told me that on M3 made in China there is a bolt between the two split rear seats that sometimes get loose. They fastened it. The second time they double checked everything. They told me that if I want they will replace the rear seats entirely. But I see that this is a very common issue and I‚Äôm afraid that it will be back.
vtfz83,jna0grl,"Can you provide more details about the resolution? I had my car serviced for a rear drive unit failure, and I got the car back with a similar sounding rattle to what you had recorded."
vtfz83,jna13de,"My first suggestion is to take some microfiber cloths, recline the seat, stick them at the base of the seat, between the seat and the trunk, put the seat back up again and perform a test drive! Another place that you can try is where the seat connects to the upper part of the trunk, there is some kind of locking mechanism."
166ujzn,jym269u,Still no Search UI or steering button customisations‚Ä¶.
166ujzn,jym321j,Same ‚Ä¶. So sad been waiting so long
166ujzn,k32b812,"It's slowly getting released it seems. My sister's car got 2023.27.6 with the latest UI(search, steering wheel button)and app(all 4 cameras) options, yesterday. I'm still waiting though. We're both on FSD Beta"
17eu7yp,k65n4j5,Our service center is awesome. Must have gotten lucky.
17eu7yp,k66mocr,Had a windshield replaced. Windshield then proceeded to leak when I washed my car a week later.

17eu7yp,k684hkh,"Same here... But at least they were friendly ""Dear Mr NeedScience, as you can see we have fixed the previous issues, looks good, right? But unfortunately, here is the new damage, please take a service appointment for us to fix it on our expense"""
17eu7yp,k6aug19,"They curbed two of my Uberturbines so bad that one of the tires needed to be replaced and two rims.  They said they had to review their photos to make sure the car didn‚Äôt come in like that ( I guess they photograph each car when it comes in? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

17eu7yp,k66fqnt,Naw and if they don't really fuck it up it's within spec after they are done anyway. They replaced the sagging headliner. Didn't fix the roof leak left scuffs from crawling on the seats and never repaired any of it.

My beef is with the techs... the first one put my wheels on the wrong sides... so my tire rotation indicators were facing the wrong way.

The second guy scratched the shit out of the lug holes and left a scratch down one of the spokes on my brand new wheels... I brought them a plastic coated socket, so they had the tools to do it right.

The desk guy did try to fix them by lightly buffing the 1 spoke and offered to pay for the wheel with the spoke scratch to be repowdercoated... but I haven't seen it in the light yet to tell if I want to go that way yet.

Then randomly the car would get squirrelly while driving 30-40 mph with loud banging like the wheels were coming off. Had the car back several more times for this issue before they again replaced the rack and pinion which immediately fixed the problem. My biggest complaint with Tesla Service is unless your problem is obvious to them they act like you have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about. Had a similar problem with the HVAC in 3 times before the issue was found and finally repaired."

That sounds like a really big hassle you must have gone through.  Hope things worked out ultimately.

I just got delivery of my Tesla model 3 long range about 72 hrs ago.

I just took delivery of my model 3 long range AWD and want to avoid any such complications at my PHYSICAL service center (""dealership"") ... Or even the mobile tech support (which I have not yet had to experience fortunately).

So what have you learned from the experience and what are you doing differently to avoid future ""mishaps"" / ""accidents""  caused by your service techs (whether the mobile ones or their on-site service center)

Thank you so much for sharing your wisdom and experience with everyone here.  As a new owner, I'd like to learn many things to take the best care of my investment possible.

So do you say that for both the Model Y and Model 3, that the 2023 variants have received a more softened suspension?

Thx"
17eu7yp,k6az8q3,"About the screw driver and tools üëâü§£

Nice of you to return them üëå

So I am actually pleased and surprised that you say Tesla has for 2023,  softened the suspension (ride) for both the 2023 Model Y and my car as well (the 2023 Model 3 LR AWD)

I actually wish my ride was a bit softer to be frank.

My tire PSI (for all wheels) was set to 41  by default out of the Freemont factory.  I am assuming you had the same PSI settings.

I would be hesitant to reduce my PSI levels down to say 38 or 39  (just in a desperate effort to make my ride even more absorbant and softer).  This would likely reduce tire life and range efficiency.

Let me know what you think mate üëç"
17eu7yp,k65voym,"Upon delivery I had a couple panels realigned. 
- For the trunk where the top corner of the trunk meets the body of the car, the two panels rubbed against each other bending both. It had to go to a body shop for a week to be fixed. https://imgur.com/a/H0Ca3rk It looks worse in person, but perfect after the repair.
- For Frunk realignment same thing except there was only paint that came off. I don‚Äôt use the front trunk at all, so I didn‚Äôt notice this till months later. I was able to wet sand and apply some touch up paint. I can‚Äôt even tell it was damage now. 
- For door realignment where the front door meets the front fender right before the repeaters, they slightly bended the fenders. I took the car on a 500 mile road trip after I got it back from the SC, so I didn‚Äôt notice the damage till I got to my destination. They denied the damage, since it was several days and several hundred miles later‚Ä¶ 
- LPT don‚Äôt have them fix panel gaps unless it‚Äôs really necessary, good chance it will come out worse. 

At a different service center I had my headliner replaced because it was attached incorrectly from the factory. While replacing the headliner they scuffed and tore every piece attached to the headliner both interior A, B, and C pillars. That‚Äôs 6 fucking pieces they damaged. And guess what somehow they cracked the headliner in the process. So they had to replace all the pillars and headliner again.

I‚Äôve had several services after. At best they don‚Äôt fix your problem and just waste your time. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve gotten a service where my issue was resolved in one visits. I avoid SC at all cost now unless it‚Äôs absolutely necessary. SC near me are a joke. Hopefully your SC is better."
17eu7yp,k66mtnl,"Not once, but twice Service scratched my driver side door sill on 2 separate occasions with their tools when removing my dash. Had to go to a body shop twice for 2 weeks each time.

When reassembling the windshield speaker grill, they forgot to push back the tabs to hold it in, they frayed the material. The replacement, they frayed it again. Replaced and forgot to push the tabs down. Another visit, push the tabs down and frayed the material. Decided to live with it.

Metal clips somehow appeared in my passenger vent. Mobile Service managed to push them way down into the car. Had to schedule another service to get them out. Months later, more clips appear in the same vent. Service didn‚Äôt take the dash apart, rather used some sort of pliers to force out the pieces, gouging the inner plastic. I emailed the contact from the satisfaction card they leave in your car. Crickets.

I have a service appointment tomorrow. Wish me luck."
17eu7yp,k6cyiao,"Don't know what they did to the Model 3 suspension if anything.

I talked to some Tesla ""reps"" at an Earth day exhibit of EVs where they said the Model Y got a suspension 'work over' after the new year."

Ok got it"
17oc3fl,k7xhqkq,"First, get a hardwired wall connector. Second you‚Äôre way over thinking this for a few dollars of electricity. 

If you‚Äôre dead set on this maybe you could set a small scheduled charging window. Outside of the window the car should only use power for preconditioning."
17oc3fl,k7xbw7t,You can set minimum to 50%. You plan sounds good to me.
17oc3fl,k7ygdq9,"You're overthinking this. Charge at work. Never plug in at home (unless you need the charge for a weekend trip). There are tens (hundreds?) of thousands of EVs that park on the street and don't follow ABC. Battery can get cold - really cold - and be fine long term. Unless you have a very low cost of electricity, you will end up spending hundreds of dollars per year just to optimize a battery."
17oc3fl,k7xlzfs,Get the Tessie app.  That app can set up very detailed schedules for charging time and charging speed based on your location and day of the week.
17oc3fl,k7xpjgb,"No, don‚Äôt need to be always charging.  Li-Ion battery doesn‚Äôt like to stay at low SOC or high SOC. So as long as you‚Äôre sitting between 20-80% don‚Äôt need to be plugged in. And it likes ambient temperature. So as long as it‚Äôs above freezing. You can let it sit. Anything outside that range. Don‚Äôt let it sit too long."
17oc3fl,k7xcvtp,"When you're plugged in at home, any preconditioning and warming of the car can be done without drawing all of that energy from the battery."
17oc3fl,k7xqjdr,Just set limit to 50% at home and leave it plugged in. Adjust limit for weekends/trips as necessary. Set your departure time so the battery can pre-condition for your daily commute. It should now charge most of the time at work.
17oc3fl,k7ybgqe,"I charge for free at work as well. Most times do not use my charger at home unless I absolutely need to go somewhere. If I don‚Äôt, charge to 80% at work and get to work with like 30% Monday and charge back up."
17oc3fl,k7xxpn0,You‚Äôre mixing up keeping it plugged in vs charging.  Just set your limit low or schedule the charge so it doesn‚Äôt charge.  I had free charging at a job and would either not plug it in or just schedule it for when I got to work.
17oc3fl,k7zigl2,I charge at work and don‚Äôt plug in at home. I cannot constantly worry about ABC.
17oc3fl,k80sqig,"Same boat as your wife - I can charge for free at work, but put a wall connector in at home to be able to quickly top off before road trips etc. 


My current plan is to just keep doing what I‚Äôm doing (charge to about 80% at work one day during the week, drive for 5-7 days, then plug back in at work to charge back to 80%)


So far I‚Äôve paid $135 in total to go 4600mi (mostly supercharging on road trips, a bit of home charging) and it makes me think twice before plugging in at home ü§£


Curious to see what % drains overnight as the weather drops below freezing."
17oc3fl,k7xcjn7,the general consensus is that for battery life you want to be at 50% state of charge for most of the battery's idle life. for me 30% is getting close to the dreaded 20% tesla warns about. but its your battery . does saving 3-4 bucks sound like a good risk for a 10k+ battery? not for me.
17oc3fl,k7xovme,My daily usage is about 5% battery. Should I still keep limit to 80%?
17oc3fl,k7xgebw,"Here is my theory for always be charging mentality. When the car is plugged in electronic systems ( unsure if tesla has this ) have the ability to directly use electricity and bypass the battery. This does two things, the extra required features can use power directly from the outlet thus reducing charging cycles and in turns extends the battery life of the car.

Again this is theory I can't confirm if tesla has this tech but it would make sense given the situation."
17oc3fl,k7xc8p3,"If your set limit is below the current SoC, there is no benefit to ‚ÄúABC‚Äù as the car will consume whatever it needs from the battery bringing it down closer to your limit.

I‚Äôd suggest finding your average usage, and setting the limit to the top end of that.  In my case, I use about 35-40%/day for my commute.  I set my charge limit to 58% and plug in every time I park both at the job and at home.  My SoC stays within about 15-20% that way, and shorter shallower cycles are best for longevity - hence the ABC advice.

YMMV.  This is just what I do."
17oc3fl,k7xdel3,Charging on weekend won‚Äôt cost you diddly.
17oc3fl,k7xjz77,Plug it in at home when it gets really cold and set a low max SoC for then. It will only charge if the battery drops below that threshold.
17oc3fl,k7z26mp,The minimum charge limit is 50%.
17oc3fl,k7z70ek,"Don‚Äôt bother to charge at home unless it‚Äôs a long weekend.  Your software settings will take care of the rest, as far as maintenance heating or cooling is concerned. Just check your settings."
17oc3fl,k7zc6c6," New model Y user here.

Had my car exactly one week. When I picked it up I was told it‚Äôs fine to charge to 100% anytime and best to plug it in every night at home.

Am I missing something here with you all setting a limit for home charging?"
17oc3fl,k7zxv24,I personally would want some margin in case she couldn't get the work charger that day or something came up or whatever but plugging it in at 50% set to charge whenever your rates are cheap would seem like a happy compromise.  Can't set it lower than that anyway.
17oc3fl,k872b4d,"Our wall socket literally melted after charging the car for 24 hours. Needless to say, I didn't do that again, and I ordered a proper charging unit the next day. A few months later, the law was changed so it's not even legal to plug the car straight into the wall. Don't risk it, get a wall unit."
17oc3fl,k7xse6x,Have had Tesla + nema adapter/mobile charger and no issue for 5 years.  What‚Äôs the push for the hard wired?
17oc3fl,k7ztrw9,"This, sounds like at most OP throws in 5% but it‚Äôs a good storage SoC and a good emergency buffer if the spontaneous came up, something many bring up when answering the SoC limit question.
Edit typo"
17oc3fl,k81r384,"0% SoC (display) is best. 100% is worst. 80-100% and 0-56% is almost the same when it comes to calendar degradation.   


A battery loves being cold when not used. As long as its above -30C for longer durations. Degradation happens slower in lower temperatures. Also, plugging in the cable when the car is not being charged will never trigger any ""keeping the battery warm""-effect. No heating will ever happen if the car doesn't charge or drive. Verified via OBD scanners.  


I also do what you do. Charge for free at work and just charge at home if I need it. This is actually better for long term health for the battery since it will have a lower average SoC over time.  


Here is a graph over SoC over time https://imgur.com/a/eTEXaqe."
17oc3fl,k81r5pq,Precondition is not needed. The battery will get to whatever temp it wants to. Preheating it before driving will only induce cost since it will heat to like 7celcius instead of like 0celcius (automatically when driving)
17oc3fl,k81rhod,Actually nothing is drained over night if Sentry is off. The car will just consume a bit more when heating the cabin and battery (if below freezing it will heat the battery to like \~0 Celcius). It will not keep anything warm and is in fact better for longevity.
17oc3fl,k7xrlrm,50-60% would be healthier for the battery. 80% wouldn‚Äôt be bad if you were using 30-40% per day. 80% isn‚Äôt even ‚Äúbad‚Äù but it is better for the battery to hover around 50% as much as possible. I use 15-25% per day and charge to 55% every night.
17oc3fl,k7xj3fc,It does not have that technology.
17oc3fl,k7xfzbr,Are you familiar with the OPs electric rates?  Or is this just a random assertion?
17oc3fl,k7zq3cc,"You probably have an LFP battery.  People with NMC are only recommended to go to 80 or 90% for daily topping off.  

For LFP batteries there's apparently no downside to topping off at 100% at all times so if that's what the service station told you and that's what your car recommends you should be fine."
17oc3fl,k7zmums,Look at your charge screen. The car will recommend a charge target for daily use.
17oc3fl,k7xtr47,"I use a plug and it‚Äôs fine. 

It‚Äôs a good argument to hardwire. Most plugs aren‚Äôt designed for continuous use at their rated amps. So you just have a low hanging fruit failure mechanism. The fix is (relatively) simple and the payoff in safety is significant. 

I just charge at a lower amperage most of the time. I have the higher setting when needed and then I‚Äôm aware of the (very slight) risks and it‚Äôs usually a one off and brief."
17oc3fl,k7xycui,I used a NEMA plug + mobile for 5 years.  Usually charged 16-24 amps.  I wanted the flexibility to go to 48 amps.  I guess you are supposed to knock off 20% for NEMA stuff like the other guy said for continuous.
17oc3fl,k806j2o,"either is fine,. the wall charger can charge at 40amps. charges slightly faster."
17oc3fl,k7y45so,"If it‚Äôs a new install as op mentioned I think it‚Äôs better to hardwire based on what we know right now. As the industry catches up I‚Äôm sure there will be better receptacles made available for charging. For people that have been doing it for years without problems, that‚Äôs great but it doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs no risk. We primarily charge at night when everyone is asleep in an attached garage so I feel better not having that risk. For almost the same cost I decided to hardwire and always recommend the same."
17oc3fl,k823iv2,I thought warming the battery in cold temperatures will help it improve efficiency while driving and therefore range? I guess it doesn‚Äôt matter if your destination is close enough and has free charging. I still would prefer a warm cabin to get into at least :)
17oc3fl,k821oly,"Interesting. I feel like I lose 1% overnight when parked with sentry off, but could also just be in my head."
17oc3fl,k7z24as,"I think, I will set the limit to 60 then. Ty"
17oc3fl,k81rbo6,"This is good advice! Degradation from SoC is basically lowest between 0% and 56% for nickel cells. A bit higher for iron cells.   
Almost the same degradation between 80% and 100% although cycling to 100% incurs some degradation for nickel based cells so shouldn't do that daily. This means its ok to leave it standing with 100% charge for a day or two without worrying."

Note

Whenever Model Y is plugged in but not actively charging, it draws energy from the charging equipment instead of using energy stored in the Battery. For example, if you are sitting in Model Y and using the touchscreen while parked and plugged in, Model Y draws energy from the charging equipment instead of the Battery."
17oc3fl,k7xll8d,Or were they assuming to charge at their work on weekends. ü§î
17oc3fl,k7y29m2,"I feel like this is FUD. No plug is rated for continuous use at their rated amps. They are all rated for 80%. The tesla adapter knows this, as such on a 30 amp circuit it runs at 24."
17oc3fl,k7xu1kb,Thanks for the insights.
17oc3fl,k7y1ru9,"You're thinking of the 80% amp limit, which doesn't change with a hard-wired connector - that's NEC code. The main reason people put in wall connectors is to be able to pull more than the 32A that the mobile connector allows."
17oc3fl,k82apwv,"If you are planning to supercharge to get to your destination and have the car connected to a charger, yes.

If you are not planning to pre-heat the battery for charging (automatically before supercharging), then you will not get a range improvement. You would just waste power to heat something that doesn't need to be heated. Essentially consuming more for driving to/from work than you should.  


You should absolutely triggering the preconditioning cabin via the app. It will also heat the battery a little bit if needed, but don't care about that. I am talking about scheduled departure that would heat the battery to like 7Celcius or something, which is not needed if you don't plan to super charge."
17oc3fl,k82b38b,"I mean, opening the app or having Summon standby will consume a little bit of power.   


An idle vehicle will not consume any power. I sometimes leave mine for a week or two and it would lose 1% or something at most."
17oc3fl,k89onvy,"My 2023 Feb mylr, what cells are used? Iron or nickel?"
17oc3fl,k7xqcu4,I believe the OP is not talking about when users are making the Tesla do things like playing games on the touchscreen. They are referring to idling during which the car draws from the battery according to the link you posted.
17oc3fl,k7xqgee,"It is not like that, the car use battery , only difference is upon the battery drop 1-2%, charging kickin.

Quite simple to verify, esp if you have wall connector, if anything use charging equipment, then you should see the charging indicator swing, or more scientifically, there are few APPs for both Android and Apple that can talk with wall connector to show it's real-time dynamic status, it displays zero current. When charging start, it can show subtle current fluctuation.

The owner manual is just a gross simplification description for layman.

You can also notice the battery drop if you use any power for extended  period while plugged in."
17oc3fl,k7y8h6w,"They asked for the reason why someone would prefer hardwire. Generally this is the reason I‚Äôve heard. There are a few others like ease of use and some don‚Äôt like that something could fall on a hot connector. That‚Äôs why they are often mounted ground on top.

Edit: I know about the 80% thing. Even then plugs fail at continuous 80%. I‚Äôve had several level 1 plugs fail at continuous 80% usage. So when I use a plug, now level 2, I stay below 80% most of the time."
17oc3fl,k7y8bea,"It is the reason I put in mine, but after 9 months of use I find I could have lived with a 32 amp limit and not had a problem. I charge to 80% at home and usually only get down to 40% -at worst- when driving during the day. I actually put a good number of miles on the car- a drive into town is 20 miles each way at a minimum and more depending on where in town I am going- but they are mostly highway miles with a couple of blocks of city stop and go driving- and I usually keep the top speed at 60 on the highways. I bought the car for efficiency and not for speed so 85% of the time I'm not lead footed. But occasionally it's fun to punch it. 

I have taken several interstate trips of 200+ miles one way and they are the only time I've had to use Supercharging stations. Otherwise I can charge at home and haven't had a range or charging time problem."
17oc3fl,k7y1ygq,That‚Äôs why I put mine in!
17oc3fl,k83ys0w,"Is that a new thing? I use a mobile connector on a 50amp outlet and it pulls 40 amps all day. It‚Äôs an older connector, from my previous car."
17oc3fl,k82ihzc,"If the ambient temperature is below freezing, I think you would want to schedule departure so that the battery warms up everything from the charger instead of using battery power itself. A cold battery will use more energy and be less efficient than a warm one."
17oc3fl,k7ysi3z,Sentry mode does use the battery like this can confirm. Once the battery goes 1-2% down the charging turns back on. I wish it wouldn't...
17oc3fl,k7yr9z7,"There is another aspect the outlet itself may not be rated for repeated insertion / removal. This is a factor on cheaper outlets.

Overall I think the outlet is fine, but I'd get a high quality one vs whatever random cheap one you find since it's a permanent install. If you had a EV Truck, then I'd go hardwired for 80 amp charging, but for a MS3XY, doesn't matter much.

Vehicles will get more efficient in the future so while there is some usage today for an 100 amp hard wired for an 80 amp charge it seems like this will be less valuable later on. No one can really say.

If you really wanted you could get a solar install and do DCFC at like 15 kw, it's not a huge cost if you plan the solar right."
17oc3fl,k7yruho,"This is why EV's are the future. Sure there are still use cases for some people / businesses, but for most home users a 32 amp NEMA outlet is fine, hell for 30% of people a 15 amp breaker is enough."
17oc3fl,k86mcwi,"A cold battery has higher resistance, yes. But it will not use more energy to draw energy, not in that size at least. I think it is just heating that will account for the extra draw.  


The problem with that is that if you schedule it for say 7am, it will start preheating the battery like 2 hours before, then the cabin like 30 min before.

Just for comparison, say that this takes 10kWh of energy, heating battery to 7 Celcius and cabin to 20 Celsius.

If you were to pre-heat the cabin 15 minutes prior to departure, you would spend like 1kWh. However, since its sub-zero temp, the battery will start heating when you drive to get to a point of around 0 Celcius. This would take maybe 3kWh extra for that drive. This would come from the battery, not the grid.

Iff you pre-heat the car via schedule departure, you would not draw these 3kWh from the battery, but you would instead draw this from the grid. If you were to do this every day, it would cost you much more to go to work instead of just using a bit more energy when driving.

For me, it takes like 4kWh to drive to work. If I would do scheduled departure whole winter, it would consume several times more energy during freezing days. I will just keep starting climate 15 minutes before departure.

If Tesla would create the option of pre-heating the car with less battery pre-heating, it would solve this."
17oc3fl,k7z1sr0,"Yeah,  so is AC etc.  those electronics can't use L2 voltage directly.  To use charging equipment without from battery üîã, extra circuits or bypass harness  are needed,  adding not insignificant cost and assembly complexities.  Many people unfortunately buy Tesla misinformation without thinking twice or pay minimum attention to proof otherwise.

Even if charging kicks in,  while charging,  the car still uses the battery"
1dqn010,lapa8kb,"The price is twice of what I would expect this work to cost.


And I am concerned that the actual make/model of the 14-50 outlet is not mentioned in the estimate. You want an outlet rated for EV or industrial usage. I fear they only plan to install the $9 Home Depot generate model, which could fail over time.


I suggest getting a couple more estimates."
1dqn010,lapipq3,"Seems a little high, especially the 14-50 receptacle, but they are using a GFCI breaker and it looks like they are installing 60 amp wiring when really 50 amp wiring would work and it looks like the distance is like 60' to the breaker box so not too bad.  Why are they installing a 60 amp breaker on a 14-50 outlet (that should only ever draw 50 Amps)? My guess they are setting it up so if you ever want to replace the 14-50 receptacle with a Tesla Wall Connector you can without having to change wiring and breaker.   I would suggest just go ahead and get the Tesla Wall Connector vs the 14-50 outlet, I don't think it's going to change the cost much."
1dqn010,lapkxqi,"Did your state mandate a GFCI breaker for level 2 charger (NEP 2020 or later)? In that case, it might be better for you to look at the wall connector, as it comes with a built in GFCI and you can legally get a cheaper breaker for the fraction of the price(about 20$)"
1dqn010,lapm8kn,"It just depends on where you are and what they are having to maneuver through or around in order to do the install.  We paid a lot more than that.  

One observation,  if you‚Äôre using a tesla third generation wall connector, have your electrician look at page 12 of that manual. It talks about ground fault protection being built in to the charger. I don‚Äôt know up from down, but the electrician will,  I just remember seeing that and it concerned me.  
We spent a lot of money because we went on the Tesla website and only used a company locally that was a certified installer from Tesla.  Sometimes you just gotta make your wife happy.  

Here is a link to that manual.  [Tesla manual 3rd gen wall charger](https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/support/charging/Gen3_WallConnector_Installation_Manual.pdf)"

1bah1b0,ku2hcgj,"That‚Äôs quite a write up, and some things I can relate to including the suspension in my 2023 LR. I can‚Äôt imagine what the non-comfort was like lol.  

Regarding the stalks, there is a setting that changes them from some of the worst stalks I have used, the default behavior you had, to what I consider excellent. 
Basically that setting changes the 3 blink to an always on until the car thinks you‚Äôve done your maneuver, ie lane change or whatever. It‚Äôs very accurate."
1bah1b0,ku2c1ny,"Thanks for the detailed write-up! 

What other EV‚Äôs are you considering or have test driven? And where do they stand compared to the MY for you?"
1bah1b0,ku3ana9,"The rumbling/ear pressure thing is a real thing. Some people seem insensitive to it, and/or maybe some vehicles are better than other. There are some ‚Äúhome remedies‚Äù for it but my impression is that they are only sometimes effective, for some people. If you pay attention you‚Äôll notice that it‚Äôs often the same person all over the web advocating that they fix the issue."
1bah1b0,ku3sqvw,"The Tesla charging network is vastly too undervalued in your assessment.   I rarely leave the tether of my home L2 charger but when i do, I need the DCFC infrastructure to be 1) dependable 2) available...3) reasonably priced.    Tesla is excellent on the first 2... okay on the third.    For my non-Tesla EV (which i sold after just 1yr).... it was an utter shitshow on all 3 counts.   Being hundreds of miles from home and having to depend on that 1 DCFC station... and watching it not function... or charge at 33kwh... exactly how many times does that have to happen before you give up on a non-Tesla EV?   I hate Elon... but damn... I hate all the other EV makers for allowing non-Tesla charging an utter mess.   This is what's going to slow down the adoption."
1bah1b0,ku48fga,"I find the notion that all the other manufacturers are going to rely on Tesla to fix their charging infrastructure issues rather idiotic.   The traditional manufacturers are not without resources or engineering capabilities to help build an infrastructure which will enable mass adoption.   It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating to see them contribute to possibly making the Tesla charging process worse or expecting another company to fix their incompetence.

Rather than make some presumably simple design changes (relocating the charging port to comply with Tesla charging) they continue to place it where they feel like placing it.  (See the latest Rivian cars).

Hubris."
1bah1b0,ku4a8bj,"This was a great write up! I‚Äôm also in the same boat, considering whether to buy now or wait a year. This write up certainly helped A LOT.

My takeaways from this and your comments: test drive each before settling. Each car seems to have pros and cons that appeal more or less to different people."

1bah1b0,ku3rs2n,"Oh, that's great to hear - I figured there must be a stalk setting and just didn't find it during my time with the car, but if the constant-on can be set for the initial, lighter push up/down then I find that very acceptable.  Thanks!

I should have also mentioned that I liked it's auto-off for turn signals after changing a lane, though it missed doing so about 5% of the time."
1bah1b0,ku2cz2r,"Hey, thanks for asking - I've driven Ioniq 5, Mach-e, ID.4 and Bolt EUV.

Also been interested in the upcoming Equinox EV and might try a Kona EV for the heck of it.

Thus far, I prefer the ID.4, as any sort of negative I wrote about the Model Y did not exist with the 2023 AWD Pro S that I've test-driven twice.  I want its 2024 model features such as battery preconditioning, which is finally integrated into the trip planning.  Its price has gone up and it would be much more expensive than the Model Y, so that gives something to think about.

I like the Ioniq 5 a lot, great displays and controls, road feel is nice and it's comfortable all-around.

The Mach-e was surprisingly well done, I felt.  But turned out to not be my style and visibility wasn't as good for me.

The Bolt EUV is not the most comfortable seating, but it's good.  It has a wild dash layout and is lots of fun.  Chevy did an amazing job for an EV you can get in the 20-something range now with tax credits and lowered prices on a 2023 model.  But no fast charging, so I just can't see pulling the trigger on it even though it ticks a lot of my boxes."
1bah1b0,ku5aw9y,"It‚Äôs the worst part of the car for me. I tightened the hatch to see if that would help, I tried letting a couple of psi out of the tires to soften the ride but still no improvement. Large bumps aren‚Äôt even the problem it‚Äôs the small stuff like cracks on the pavement that result in a low frequency pressure in the cabin. I‚Äôve never had another car that did it."
1bah1b0,ku3q1qt,"Interesting!  I really feel that somehow here wrote about it - with the possible remedy - in a thread not long ago, so when I experienced it with this rental (and not in my test drives with other cars), that vague recollection came back."
1bah1b0,ku3way4,"Thanks for that feedback.

I offered this summary to try and show my appreciation of its value, actually:

>We hear so much about Tesla's charging infrastructure advantage and it's real, IMHO: but that extends to their navigation with trip planning, battery preconditioning, car + Supercharger handshakes, car/app display of status and even integration with your account for payment. That's a lot of integration points and Tesla manages it very well, IMHO.

And I did note in the TLDR that I felt it was one of its top selling points, it really is a value-add for Tesla cars (compared to the competition.)  But, some of that will be mediated as the network continues to open up, which I feel also shows the value of Tesla's charging network investment by enabling the larger EV adoption we all want to see."
1bah1b0,ku6dyfd,I hope Tesla will start charging cars with the port in the wrong place a 2x fee multiplier at v3 stations that are over 50% occupied. Terrible experience for everyone if there are blocked spots while people are waiting. It seems optimistic to hope that v4 chargers will be everywhere in a few years.
1bah1b0,kubem0a,"I look at as Tesla is going to help increase EV adoption in the short term, but competition will be updating to better compete in this space because of Tesla's soon-to-be ubiquitous presence (at least for level 3+ Supercharger sites.)

There is also a new multi-brand EV network planned:

https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a46728807/ionna-ev-charging-network-announced/

I've seen the EA and Chargepoint have planned to reinvest in their current install base as they add-to and change sites to NACS connectors, so we'll see."
1bah1b0,ku4xsc6,"Look at the prices connected and it‚Äôs clear why the model y is the best selling car in the world. Nothings perfect but for the price, it‚Äôs a great value."
1bah1b0,kubdzj9,"Glad it gave you some practical ideas!

Yeah, definitely recommend test-driving before buying.  With Subarus I know where they stand over twenty years and five cars, but for all these EVs it's a new world out there.

Tesla has the most unique road manners and driver feedback from what I've tried thus far, and that's even before considering the unique controls - it's a change in many ways from a lot of ICE cars I've driven (over 45 years.)  But as I said, even with its unique aspects, you can get the operations basics down after your first 1-2 test drives and from there it's refining your knowledge and interaction with the vehicle.

As another poster implied, the pricing was the primary reason I checked them out (also mentioned this in my post).  I'm beyond that point now as competition has been heating up and my test drives+rental showed me what I favor vs what it offers, admittedly.

In fact, without my even haggling a local VW dealer gave me a slightly better price (after fees and taxes) for a new 2023 ID.4 AWD Pro S than Tesla offered for their local inventory Model Y Long Range (five seats) models and it was very tempting, but I wanted to wait for the 2024 ID.4 because of the better battery management.  If that doesn't come through when they arrive (i.e., the ID.4 prices went up markedly, against the grain of other EV brands in this segment), then I'll be looking at other brands like Hyundai, Chevrolet (who apparently figured out the ship-level problems in their Ultium platform), etc. before circling back to Tesla as a possible backup."
1bah1b0,kubdbj6,"My Subaru Crosstrek felt like a Lexus after three days with the Tesla, which was rather unexpected.

I'm just being objective here.  I could possibly put up with the Model Y's unrefined suspension, but it's not my preference when it comes to road feel.  I also don't get much feedback from the suspension in terms of turning strength and tracking, so have to keep on track entirely by sight.   Again, not undriveable, but not how I prefer a car to feel.

Everyone has their own preferences, so mine don't have to be the same as someone else's.  I've owned six brands of cars over 45 years of driving and I don't think any of them would be considered luxury except possibly my 1998 Audi A4, I like responsive suspensions that are tighter vs boaty, especially when they are tuned well or at least give you reasonable road feel through the steering wheel and/or body without battering you senseless."
1bah1b0,kubccj9,"Me, I was up with a headache and couldn't sleep.  It was meant to helpful for other shoppers, but also was a way to get my own thoughts down and see how I actually felt about the car.  Sometimes writing or talking about something helps to clarify how you actually feel/think about it.

Thanks for your comment."
1bah1b0,ku2rt1m,"That VW is going to have none of the Tesla supercharger integration at a much higher price.

I think your writeup/experience is missing two major things

1) plan a route somewhere that you can't get without charging. It'll route you automatically through superchargers and tell you your projected battery at each stage. When you're driving to a destination in a charging hole, like my MIL house,  you can tell it you're going there and then home and it'll program charging stops to make sure you have enough to do that,  while letting you kinda plan on and around miles- if you can't just plug into 110 overnight. 

2) I think you didn't get used to the one pedal. On the highway,  you can modulate speed with one pedal in this car better than any sports car you've ever driven. It's the same principle as engine breaking, but with full engine control instead of the 10% or so that you get from rpms so it's much more sensitive.  It takes about a week, but i haven't used my brakes in 3 months. You just need to feather your gas less and more slowly than ICE. Like a new teen driving a stick.  I experience no more fatigue in this than anything else... esp if you turn on autopilot on highway. Which is really good."
1bah1b0,ku2f5ms,Can't see paying more for an ID.4 but perhaps I'm biased because the Passat I owned has been so problematic as has the dealership. Love my Model Y! (Bought 2.5 months ago) The only thing I miss is Android Auto.
1bah1b0,ku2fuqd,"When they were out of Model Ys at the Hertz counter, they gave us an eMustang GT and I was surprisingly impressed with the car. Now that it will be able to use Superchargers makes it a contender."
1bah1b0,ku4dit3,"Can you elaborate on the Mach-E not being your style. In what way?

I had this car on my list."
1bah1b0,ku6nkbb,"This. Exactly this. I just got a new Model Y LR a week ago, and the sound booms around the car at medium speeds (like 35-40 mph). It has affected my enjoyment of the vehicle, for sure. 

I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs 50% louder at 35-40 mph than my 2022 hybrid Kia."
1bah1b0,kubodiu,"Good way to describe it, I noticed the rumbling and pressure even more when on a twisty 45MPH road after work, it would get worse when I went over 40MPH and sort of gradually disappear when I slowed for traffic or lights.  It's wasn't like a light switch, but something that grew and waned.

Almost as if there was a resonance growing in the car that would finally reach a breakthrough point that made it more noticeable, such that when the pressure and rumbling hit your head it was already too late to avoid or make it die down quickly by changing how or where you drive.  I was wondering if it might be inherent in the dynamics of the car's powertrain affecting the cabin."
1bah1b0,ku5b2uw,It‚Äôs to lengthen the rubber stops on the hatch so that the hatch will close tighter. It supposedly fixes a sound buffeting issue. It did nothing to help the pressure issue in my Model Y.
1bah1b0,ku2s39s,"Oh.  And talking to a sales representative? Wtaf dude lol.  Literally the best part of buying a tesla is not talking to a salesman. The website is easy, intuitive,  and there are no hidden fees. And you don't spend 6 hours in a dealer"
1bah1b0,ku3rg5p,"Pretty sure I got it on the highway fine, but if you lift off the pedal it automatically starts to brake of course - that's by design.  It slows or accelerates immediately, based on how much pressure you offer on the pedal.

In an ICE car, you continue to glide when lifting off the pedal and it very gradually starts to slow - there are plenty of moments on the highway with ICE cars where my foot is just sitting on the accelerator and not pressing down, just waiting for my speed to module a bit before I add some gas only as needed to maintain speed within a few MPH.

So, the non-regen experience is generally lighter on the pedal for me.  The ID.4 even has a non-regen driving mode which I tried and it felt exactly like being in an ICE car.

I actually tried to put my destination into the Navigation app, where it nicely showed me starting vs ending charge levels, then I tried to put in my desired destination charge and expected it to route me through Superchargers automatically, but it didn't seem to catch.  So, I was probably doing something wrong, tried it a few times.  Eventually, I just navigated to a mid-point Supercharger site which was relatively open and let it manage that trip, then while charging I put in my destination manually.

EDIT: And I was downvoted for . . . something! :D  Keep being you, folks."
1bah1b0,ku3s8s7,"Yeah, agree.  And that really applies to so many cars, too - since I've been looking at the ID.4 (for example) and VW is adopting Tesla's network in 2025, that gave me a much better sense of comfort for trip planning without a Tesla.

But I still saw integrated battery preconditioning as a necessity, meeting at least parity in that regard with what Tesla already offers to speed up charges when you arrive."
1bah1b0,kubcufw,"Oh, just in terms of actual styling, really - plus, I've had a boycott against Ford since the 1990s, but wanted to be open-minded and tried the car.

I would definitely recommend a test drive: it's smooth, handles well and has a nice suspension.  Controls are more to my liking - i.e., status is in front, operations are in the big display - and while it's not quite as smooth as the Tesla's interface, it's still very good.  I also like having more options directly on the steering wheel and they did a fine job there."
1bah1b0,kubcluv,"Thanks, yeah - that was it.  Sorry it didn't relieve the symptoms in your car, though."
1bah1b0,ku3q9fs,"Well, he called me, as I mentioned.  Then he followed up via the Tesla group chat which got started from test drive signup.

So, I went along with his reachout to see where that would go."
1bah1b0,ku6d204,"I agree with you. Without TACC, the opd can be tiring for a long road trip. I encountered this driving my MY home 2.5hrs from pickup since an autopilot camera wasn‚Äôt working so TACC was disabled. For long drives, TACC works well."
1bah1b0,l0aukqy,I recently bought a 2023 ID.4 Pro S Plus and don‚Äôt miss battery preconditioning at all. Charged from 20-80% at a 350 kw EA charger in 28 minutes. Barely had time for a bathroom break and lunch.
1bah1b0,l0awy12,"That's great!  I have been reading reports on Reddit of such successes, which is encouraging.

Curiously, that's faster than it took for my rented Modey Y LR to charge from 30-80% at a L2 Supercharger station, where preconditioning was used as part of the trip planning in the car.  It started at 140 and went down almost linearly from there."
1bah1b0,l0deqhj,Most superchargers are 250 kW. Maybe the extra 100 kW at EA makes a difference? I think the charge started at 170 kW.
eoxry7,fefuioz,that's really weird with the clear lane lines
eoxry7,fefut0a,"I had that happen twice on my 4k mile California road trip over the holidays. Doing 80mph+ on a highway turn and it just drifts right out of lane with no warnings. The recent version of autopilot sucks right now on that front. It was much better on my roadtrip in August. The no notifications when needing to take over being the main issue. 

I only had it happen once on that level previously over most of my first year when autopilot froze up entirely. 

Otherwise the ping ponging across lanes was also just as annoying. I did probably 80% of my drive on autopilot, but it got much worse recent on the current software."
eoxry7,fefv500,"This exact same thing happened to me just last week! Ironically, I was explaining to my friend the bright future of self driving cars. Then proceeds my Model 3 attempting to kill us all by hard veering without warning into the adjacent lane..."
eoxry7,fefvxyp,Wow this is one of the strangest autopilot screw ups I've seen...
eoxry7,fefyoik,V2.5 or V3 hardware?
eoxry7,fefzsno,"Heartily agree. I've had my 3 since Dec 2018 and I take the same route to work each day (surface roads to freeway, freeway to exit, exit to office). I use NoA and it's a breeze, regardless of traffic. Always signals, then takes the exit with aplomb. Until yesterday. When it came time to turn on signal and take the exit, it failed to do so. I had to force the wheel to move the car into the exit lane or it would simply sailed right past it and stayed on the freeway. There were no cars or untoward objects in my path or even near, so I haven't got the slightest idea why it bugged out. But I did report it. Unfortunately, it has now transformed my confidence to fear that it will fail again and there's nothing I can do about it."
eoxry7,fegjvv0,"Consider sending this footage to autopilotfeedback@tesla.com

I'm not sure if the inbox is still monitored, but it's worth a shot."
eoxry7,fefuqy3,Weird! And it‚Äôs a bridge you were going over. Hard to say why it got confused
eoxry7,fefvtcb,"I believe the problem there is the slight bump coupled with the change in color of the road surface. 

AP in my car tends to act up on two stretches of road I frequent when the road surface goes from lighter concrete to dark asphalt and back in both spots. Cannot be coincidence. 

Also these are both sorta backroads so no traffic either."
eoxry7,fefx2ax,Some type of regression where it doesn‚Äôt handle changes in road surface color very well. Most of these veering movements tend to happen because the car is trying to recenter itself it what it thinks is a lane. Possible that it saw the dark discoloration down the center of the lane next to you and thought it was a lane line or road edge. Unusual regression for sure.
eoxry7,feg2z9p,"My car recently did something very similar: https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/egnvx0/be_extra_vigilant_using_ap_with_40501_installed/

No idea what exactly caused it to swerve out of the lane unexpectedly. Seems like the car should have been able to handle this fairly straightforward situation."
eoxry7,fegsvb7,"> It goes to show that one really should keep a hand on the steering wheel when driving on autopilot.

Exactly. This is the reason why it's important to keep the hands ON the steering wheel and not ""somewhere close"". Simply watching the road is not sufficient. This is a great example for this."
eoxry7,fegrfzl,Happened to me yesterday too! There was even a car in the lane next to me.
eoxry7,feg26zo,"No way that the bump moved your hand enough where you torqued the wheel and if disengaged right?

That's absolutely bizzare behavior, will have to add it to the mental list of things I watch our for!"
eoxry7,feg46ux,"> It goes to show that one really should keep a hand on the steering wheel when driving on autopilot

Like it says in the manual. It's just a bunch of assisted driving features. Hands on the wheels and eyes on the road at all times."
eoxry7,feg2smq,"I noticed something similar. When I spread up manually on a ramp to the y desired speed and enabled autopilot, it started to veer off into adjacent lane. Had to disable it immediately. 

Another time, the NOAP started making a lane change and there was another car which moved into the same lane and it did not abort and I had to take it off. 

As much as I love AP and NOAP, I realize you can never fully trust it."
eoxry7,feg9k0x,I have been using autopilot in my Model S for 2 years. done more than 45000km. Yes need to be very careful. I have encountered plenty of near misses. It still far from totally reliable. I live in Australia.
eoxry7,fegioq5,It was asserting dominance over the other car.
eoxry7,fegnzg9,"Mine also tried to veer out of its lane.  I was in stop and go traffic, doing maybe 5 mph.  There was a Prius next to me it tried to merge into.  Also on a curve.  Had my hand on the wheel, of course, so quickly overrode it."
eoxry7,fegp6h3,"Mine did the same yesterday morning, going about 5km/h in traffic, all the sudden I noticed the car is turning left into the highway shoulder. It was weird, I grabbed the steering and can feel the fighting me then autopilot turned off. The rest of the trip on autopilot was fine."
eoxry7,fegx9pu,"I would just like to say good on you for being attentive while using autopilot. Nothing in this world is perfect, and you potentially saved yourself and the person autopilot may have hit."
eoxry7,fegxgg1,Another contributing factor that I haven't seen anyone mention is there was a sign overhead on top of the fact that the pavement was changing color. Could be that combination confused autopilot.
eoxry7,fehtnk5,I've noticed mine doing that kind of thing more and more lately.  not sure what regressed here.
eoxry7,fehycqu,Mine did something similar going across RR tracks yesterday. I had my hands ready as I never trust it around RR tracks.
eoxry7,feik501,That‚Äôs scary. Question: how did you calculate how many miles you‚Äôre car has done on AP? Or is it shown somewhere?
eoxry7,fefvmde,Somehow seems like the bump had something to do with it.  Maybe it caused some camera misalignment or something?
eoxry7,feg7vcv,"Ended well luckyly. This is also why I personally think FSD is very far away, because of the weird things that only rarely happen (every few hundred or even then thousand kilometers or miles)"
eoxry7,fegvynl,This goes to show how far away we are from L4/L5 automation.
eoxry7,feg5c0v,"maybe it's because of the big dark splotch on the road right after color transition? perhaps it's confusing the camera into thinking there's something there, like a deep puddle or something. looks like you're in CA. I'd straight up drive to Palo Alto Tesla and be like, ""WTF fix it bra"""
eoxry7,fehdee5,There's a set of tire skid marks that leads to the grass on a highway I drive and my car tries to take it about 40% of the time.
eoxry7,fehenb1,"Ruhroh.

[Remember that video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYQYxGEOt94&feature=youtu.be&t=24) of the car losing traction in the rain and slamming into the wall? Happened right as he went onto a bridge just like this.

Also this: https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/eh15pr/our_model_3_tries_to_kill_my_family_too_often_on/

You add a lot of rain, I could see this movement causing a spin out."
eoxry7,fehgh1v,"On Dec 31, I was parallel parking on street. The curb is low enough that when I pulled in head first, I drove the front right wheel over it to make it easier to park. I was creeping to position my car when it surged forward suddenly. I immediately hit the brakes but car still went good 5-6 feet before stopping. 

Some of are probably thinking I pressed the accel pedal hard by accident, and when I heard stories like this in the past I thought the same. But that was not the case. I immediately did the bug report but who knows if that will log/share car telemetry with Tesla. 

As I got through the wtf moment, I started thinking what could have caused this. Software? I've heard software is designed to accelerate to get out of danger. Was it the act of driving unto the sidewalk?"
eoxry7,fei3p9p,The way the sun lined up with that overhead road sign it created a fairly strong shadow over the center and right lanes but not as much on the left. I wonder if the system was trying to make an evasive manoeuver around it?

eoxry7,fefx31w,"I agree, AP in 50.x has regressed quite a bit: hugs tight corners to the point of going over the center line, overswings on lane changes and takes seconds to recover to the center of the lane, blinks left when staying in the rightmost lane instead of taking an off ramp (in a light left turn)..."

eoxry7,fegtxi5,Haha I swear I never have any issues with summon or autopilot until someone else is there to witness it
eoxry7,feguher,Would it hard veer if a car was next to you in the direction of the veer?  That would be an interesting test.
eoxry7,feilnds,"Maybe they updated this software to be sloppy and force it to learn by more human takeovers. 

Maybe not though."
eoxry7,fegsb09,How are we supposed to give feedback otherwise?
eoxry7,fehuun1,it's possible it was using NoA data from the lane bellow.  I've had it do this...scary
eoxry7,feg7zi8,"Confirm this behavior on a overpass that changes between dark and light concrete, but also has a incline and decline. After heading down decline it will pick up something and head left... never will it go right."
eoxry7,fegzcep,It looks exactly the same like what happened to me.
eoxry7,feh6d6t,"This was my first thought as well, though the disengage tone should have alerted the driver, so it's probably more likely an autopilot issue."
eoxry7,feg31gx,That‚Äôs a good suggestion
eoxry7,fegt0zf,That's too bad.  In [this](https://www.tesla.com/autopilot?redirect=no) video from 2016 Tesla had an autopilot system so good the driver didn't have to do anything and was only there for legal reasons.  And that was on surface streets!

eoxry7,fefyd9g,I'm trying to understand what their new AP strategy is designed to improve on.  Maybe city roads?  I wish they could bring back the old AP code for interstates at least.  The car is much less confident and more dangerous (especially on curves) than it previously was.
eoxry7,feibt0r,Mine decided to take a ramp at 70 mph that it used to slow down to 50 for......
eoxry7,fehfrjn,There was a car in the left lane. It was a little bit behind me so you can't see it in the video.

eoxry7,feguko1,"That's still the goal and I have no doubt there are internal builds that can do that already under certain or maybe many conditions, but they're not ready for mass market yet. The capabilities you see in the car today are most definitely not the latest and greatest the AP team have developed, they're just the ones in a state that is ready for the masses, bearing in mind that the masses include people who do dumb things, don't pay attention/hold the wheel and traverse a vast variety of road types and conditions. It will take time for those capabilities to be production-grade but I have no doubt they will get there, at some point..."

eoxry7,fegn1vm,I have that same sudden pitch change on a curve like that and drive it every day without issue.
eoxry7,feg1ztu,"Mine often hits the brakes going under bridges in sunny weather, where there‚Äôs a sharp lighting change from the bridge‚Äôs shadow."
eoxry7,feghf3q,"Ugh concrete barriers.  When they said that they were going to have AP ""move over"" for trucks or whatever, I knew exactly what was going to happen at the one part of my commute where the barriers are basically right on the lane.  AP now gets about 3 inches from those barriers to give trucks a solid 3 feet.  It's fucking stupid."
eoxry7,fegua0u,Lol....the fact you need to do this yet people still believe FSD is possible with this sensor suite is god damn hilarious.
eoxry7,fegk7v9,Yep. When the pavement turns light gray right underneath the sign is when it perhaps couldn‚Äôt see the white lane markings on top of the lighter pavement.
eoxry7,feh5pab,Sounds like driving but with added complexity! lol
eoxry7,feiumre,"That's what I saw, too. At second 0:06, you can see how it's tracking the contrast in the dark surface but suddenly the ""lane markings"" best contrast in the lighter surface is between oil marks in the middle of the lanes. It wants to align itself between those two which takes it to the left."
eoxry7,feg2w1l,"My rudimentary understanding is that it's AI doing the steering. And with AI, there is not a whole lot of human-written code that you can easily ""bring back"", without just reverting to the older version wholesale.

Instead, you have a bunch of training data that you use to make an ""artificial brain"" really good at a certain set of tasks. What you can influence is the quality of the training data, and the way you reward/punish the learning neural network for getting it right/wrong.

Unfortunately that means that you can also tweak it in a way that makes the AI worse at certain things. And IIRC, it takes something like 70,000 hours of computing to re-train the network... so it's not like you can easily just tweak some dials if a regression isn't found before shipping..."
eoxry7,fefymdu,"At the same time as those issues, I noticed a distinct improvement in it holding to the preferred side of the lane when an on-ramp lane has a long merge-in area (where it used to swing to the middle of the converging lanes where there‚Äôs no line). Hopefully the next update fixes the regressions and maintains the improvements."
eoxry7,fefyu8g,Love my ap1
eoxry7,feilkf5,Yeah. It got way worse at managing appropriate speeds for turns on the current software.
eoxry7,fehxzuq,Historically people say that voice command is feel-good and doesn't actually do anything.
eoxry7,fehanci,Mine just did something very similar a few weeks ago. https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/egnvx0/be_extra_vigilant_using_ap_with_40501_installed/
eoxry7,fegvl3p,"AP that swerves out of its lane because of a bump and road surface color change is ""ready for the masses""?"
eoxry7,fen4oc7,"> We don't know how many takes were ended because the driver had to take control

Yes we do - zero.  The video clearly says the driver didn't even need to be there, they were only there for legal reasons.  Are you suggesting Tesla lied?"
eoxry7,fegswat,"Mine loves to brake for signs and whatnot. In one tunnel it doesn‚Äôt overtake vehicles... it‚Äôs so weird. It‚Äôs gotten better since I got the car in September, but far from perfect. The inconsistency is what gets me. I‚Äôm using the report problem command quite often hoping that the collected data will help."
eoxry7,feh8vf0,"This is because in the spline data of AP, AP has since 2015, black listed bridges after the Joshua Brown incident.  It will not engage AEB in bridge areas (as black listed in the AP spline data) and instead often ghost brakes as a defensive response to bridges (vision is turned off because it gets confused and thinks it will crash)."
eoxry7,feh2a85,It was the sign. Mine does this all the time (usually just brakes) and is not bothered by color changes.
eoxry7,feglowd,I thought that was a BRR thing.
eoxry7,fegj9mi,"I thought the bridge issue was because the car gets confused about speed limit differences and which road it's ""on""?"
eoxry7,fegmsof,I also hate how NoA will move to a shoulderless lane like 3‚Äù from a barrier when there are tons of other lanes just because two miles down the road there‚Äôs an exit. I always end up death gripping the wheel in these situations since there‚Äôs basically no margin for error.
eoxry7,fegwv8v,Just needs more software!
eoxry7,fegwxx4,"""It's not perfect yet, therefore it will never work!"""
eoxry7,fege7d0,"They do have the network segmented, so can theoretically train only parts at a time. (With complications on shared nodes.)

I thought they were using the network just for image recognition though, and that the micro route planning was still hard coded... in which case they could maybe fix this without touching the network."
eoxry7,fegml8d,[deleted]
eoxry7,fehabok,"I do agree that it got better on that in about 75% of the scenarios, but if lane changing into an open merge lane, it would ping pong all over the place. Autopilot did show some improvement on avoiding centering into the open lane, but still nowhere near what a human does."

eoxry7,fegvqgc,"As long as the company is clear you have to have your hands on the wheel at all times and be ready to take over, sure.  But that is why having videos on their website with a completely contradictory message really isn't a great idea."
eoxry7,fegx1a9,"There will always be corner cases and the company will have to work to fix them. Same with any software and most complex products - Windows still crashes sometimes, tens of millions of Takata airbags were found to be defective despite ""Japanese quality"", the [best-selling vehicle in North America has issues that might make it stall or catch fire](https://www.cars.com/articles/2019-2020-ford-f-150-recall-alert-412897/) and so on.

In short, very few complex products are perfect and it's probably an unachievable and pointless goal for most, so don't be surprised to see issues, especially when a company like Tesla is bringing to market completely ground-breaking technology. 

The real concern for me would be how quickly the company responds and on that I'd say Tesla is up there with the best - companies like Ford and Takata eventually admit to issues (usually after lawsuits), send their snail-mail notifications and owners drag themselves into their dealers. Tesla typically detects issues and fixes serious ones with over the air fixes in days or weeks. Starkly different approaches and response times."
eoxry7,fegmp00,What's BRR?
eoxry7,fegydbw,"If this is the case, shouldnt it also do this in the middel of a tunnel if theres a road over/under you?

Ive only experienced it in tunnel openings and at shadows on the road from the road above me, never below me.

eoxry7,fegz4ep,Sorry to break it to you but its SOOOO far from perfect that there is pretty clearly no way it's going to be able to deal with varying road conditions. Come on....you basically have to have your head in the sand to think it's anywhere even close to self driving.
eoxry7,feifo7i,Good to know!
eoxry7,fegmztt,"the lines get a bit blurry.

For instance the detection of lane lines and the positioning of them is ML driven, but where in the lane the car is driving toward is ""human written"".

But that means if the ML algorithm mis-detects where the lane lines are, or thinks something is in front of the car when it isn't, the ""human written"" code will still try to stay in the badly-detected lane or avoid the object as if it were real."
eoxry7,feh8h0u,"""AI"" is a loaded term that means everything-computers nowadays (Witness the ""chess"" that says AI).

NNs are only used for perception in the car, the results are then cross-referenced against maps, fused with radar, ultrasonics are consulted as needed and then conventional code makes steering decisions."
eoxry7,fei81tw,"This is true, but it has been said that these aren't acted on unless there's specific circumstances, like contacting CS/SC with timestamp. They aren't all individually observed due to that voice action."
eoxry7,fek6in9,...when the car is brought to the service. Not OTA.
eoxry7,fegpmsj,"Sorry, I heard it referred to as Brake on Radar Return. The car may brake approaching bridges and overpasses because the radar thinks it is an obstruction ON the road."
eoxry7,fegzbhq,I don't have to believe it's close to perfect to believe that they can get close enough with software.
eoxry7,feh0cc0,You‚Äôre insane if you think being better than humans is that far away. Have you watched car crash videos? Do you know how many accidents there are every day? Humans suck at driving and being better than us isn‚Äôt a high bar.
eoxry7,feifty0,"This actually gives me hope, because on the display, the lines appear in the correct location relative to the car.

It's just that the car doesn't straighten out the wheel in time, and ends up turning a bit too far."
eoxry7,fegs26l,[deleted]
eoxry7,feh2gas,Non moving objects are not taken into account by radar to avoid this. The braking under bridge are due to the camera thinking it might be a wall or something. :-p
eoxry7,fehdsm7,"This video showed the car is worse than a human given zero external inputs. Stuff like this is what's going to have to be at near-zero before FSD can be given a free pass when it fails to handle a bad driver in a perfect manner. I trust a car to attempt to save my butt if it's faster than I am to react, but if I can't trust it in a straight line..."
eoxry7,fegssid,"It's hard to draw the line. If the ""human written"" code says ""just stay in the exact middle between 2 lane lines"", and the neural network code puts the lane lines in crazy places, which one of those 2 would you say is ""steering the car""? Personally I'd say both of them are, they're intrinsically connected, but depending on how you define the words you may disagree.


So in my opinion while the poster above is wrong about the amount of human written code (as there is a lot of human-written code here), they are right that a mistake made by the AI can cause the car to veer off course like this, and that mistake can sometimes be difficult to understand and fix."
eoxry7,fehl1zd,You realize humans wreck hundreds of times a day in a straight line right? You simply don‚Äôt know the stats for how often humans wreck in good conditions with no external contributors.
eoxry7,fehmum2,The only reason this wasn't a wreck is luck. On a straight road with nothing to avoid this car failed to stay between the lines. Yes some humans fail to do that- they are considered bad drivers.

I don't think they should make it even heavier to accommodate a less aerodynamic style. Besides, it wouldn't fit with the rest of their lineup and their established brand image."
7vl8dh,dttgu5g,"> having a tow range with 300+mi. is a must.

Good luck. That would need a 200 kWh battery. A hybrid Ford F-series might suit you better."
7vl8dh,dttqzev,"I really hope it has >10kW of power available from the HV battery via an inverter and a bank of different outlets (120V/20A, 240V/30A/50A).  That would allow it to replace a generator both on the work site and while camping."
7vl8dh,dtu8f9m,"I want it to fit in a standard size garage.  That is an absolute deal breaker for me.  I prefer unibody, even on a truck.  Unibody works fine for everything I would ever tow.  My current truck is unibody and its just better."
7vl8dh,dtt8law,"I think more than half of these are within a very likely realm of possibility: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 are all very likely. And 8 may be expanded upon what you requested. Why power things using the 12v when they can just install an inverter right in the truck, pulling energy straight from the big battery? You‚Äôll probably see normal household plugs in the truck on top of what you requested. Power an entire campsite with your truck.

7vl8dh,dttw0ye,The vast majority of trucks are sold to people who will never tow anything or go remotely off road in the entire life of the vehicle. They are more of a status symbol these days buying 70k+ fully loaded trucks with chrome everything and then making sure it's always perfectly clean
7vl8dh,dtujjr6,"Used car lots are full of pickups with clean unscratched beds and no marks on the receiver for a reason. For every person who needs a truck there are probably ten who don't and drive one anyway. Tesla still needs to chase the mass market. The upshot to electric is that the drivetrain gets simpler to make and put in all sorts of trucks, so I am certain in five to ten years you will see a wide variety of offbeat vehicles like the Bollinger B1.

c4gv6b,es3wh2l,Just to follow up on my post. Some more highway driving and definitely it is purposely moving to the left and right of the lane based on the sonar. AP1 has never worked so well in.

kgxsp7,gr02n1n,Wasnt the idea of this utilitarian design to be built like a tank with as simple shapes as possible. least amount of processing. The steel sheets are cheap. Anyone who can weld could fix this no problem and it would look cool in a way. It stands out so much itll be topic of discussion instantly. The flat thick surfaces you can probably weld a bunch of anchor points for tools.

kgxsp7,gglifqj,"My father is a huge fan of pickups.  He has one absolute requirement for the truck bed.  A 4' by 8' sheet of sheetrock should fit between the wheel wells.  If it can't lay flat, it can easily be damaged.  I believe the Cybertruck meets that requirement.

My father also has a preference that  a 4' by 8' sheet fits with the tailgate up.  The cybertruck doesn't meet that criteria, but the multipurpose tailgate more than makes up for it.

I think the pickup buyers who care about bed space will be satisfied.  But  I know that's a tiny percentage of the market."

What manufacturing challenges? BOF vehicles are arguably cheaper to build than unibody vehicles. There is nothing complicated about a ladder frame. Larger margins is why the big 3 are so in love with trucks.

Worse in some ways but better in others. A BOF design would allow for more payload/towing. It would make collision repair a whole lot easier and cheaper. Also, a BOF truck would make the CT an option for people who don't want to use the factory bed."

I'm less familiar with specific rules, but it mostly obeyed what was in OpenStreetMaps.

That being said, qhile the navigation data says 2020.48, I'm pretty sure we're getting newer map updates, and the map version numbers aren't changing. 

I marked roads near my house as ""Under construction"", and deleted a road entirely, as it has been rerouted, and the car has accepted that change when routing, after about a week.

But debating that aside, I do think this is something they can train vision to handle. It‚Äôs just not something they‚Äôve done yet. I see zero other SDCs testing in my area"
rv6mir,hr3sken,Ah. I get that.   I have not taken mine to the land of ice and snow.   But I would be worried if I did.
rv6mir,hr3xfp9,Sounds about right. Really need those neural networks to adapt to snow environment
rv6mir,hr4oywg,White on black signs are in Ottawa along the parkways
rv6mir,hr3wgt2,"I would argue that now is when you should be using it the most to help them refine things, but yes, I agree with you on prioritizing normal roads, as 8 months of the year normal roads are normal.

Going to be interesting to see how it works in snow a month from now, and a year from now.

I love a better solution to keeping the cameras clean though."
rv6mir,hr51ip1,How precisely do you train to differentiate between a drift and a road covered in snow. Both are uniformly coloured with little visual features. It is literally white on white on white with overcast skies there are no shadows either.
rv6mir,hr3u4m1,"I wanted to visit family and saw an opportunity to use it on a long trip.

I've done Tampa, GL to Moultrie, GA and it worked fine, but once you get up north it gets sketchy.

It did handle the lights in Quebec fairly well, but they need it to work in snow more reliably"
rv6mir,hr3x33g,"Yeah I still am using it now from time to time but it‚Äôs really 5-10 seconds between disengagements with our current road conditions. Apart from tire grooves everything else is solid ice so I really can‚Äôt afford it deviating from what I do too much. 

A challenge of this area is that the use of road salt is prohibited because it pollutes the lake too easily so other than some scraped up tracks for reasonable driving the rest of the road surface is not really usable. 

Already sent feedback that the system needs to understand how to follow tire grooves in order to succeed at winter Tahoe driving. Probably true in other areas too."
rv6mir,hr527o9,Lots and lots of data to train with
rv6mir,hr3z5w2,"I appreciated the summation. I wasn't trying to be snarky and glad you responded seriously. I live in Central Texas.  And for me 10.8 is awesome so far.  Though I doubt it can handle Austin, I used it to go to a New Years party out in the country near Lake Belton. it was awesome.  So much better then 10.6.1.  And it was fun to say ""where is the booze my car will drive me home""!  LOL but it was a dry party.

I just tell friends I am not a youtuber so not trying to break it.  It still does some things wrong, but nothing that has endangered me yet.  As long as I am not in Austin it's biggest thing seems to be getting into the wrong lane.   It is getting better at least.  That is what's important to me."
rv6mir,hr444fq,"Well, until those tire tracks lead to danger.

Saw one spot where rhe tire tracks go right into a forest median and where a car crashed previously in the trees.

Was amusing to see an untold story there"
rv6mir,hr9joaa,I wouldn‚Äôt even bother turning FSD on. It‚Äôll still learn by you driving. Probably more than disengagements every few seconds.
rv6mir,hr44dmt,"Don't want to break it either way, but yeah, some areas work better rhan others.

It's getting there, but still quirky"
rv6mir,hr44js0,Yeah‚Ä¶. Gotta love all the corner cases to generalization!
rv6mir,hr9k2hc,I see little to no telemetry being sent on passive drives like that. But disengagement and engagement drives both upload hundreds of MB when I return home.
rv6mir,hr9lphl,"Interesting. I usually get a bit over 4GB uploaded whether I let it drive or not. Once in a while it will be less if nothing happened during the drive but there have only been a couple instances of that. 

I‚Äôll have to do a couple test drives later and pay more attention to the uploads."
rv6mir,hr9m5qk,"There could be other factors involved like whether or not there‚Äôs ‚Äúshadow mode‚Äù triggers that you are hitting that I‚Äôm not hitting. But Tesla doesn‚Äôt seem to think driving around locally on snow covered roads is interesting, but they do seem to take interest in almost all AP-engaged driving on FSDBeta cars"
vf9rr2,icuqgc9,I keep mine on assertive and sometimes the car is a bit wild LOL
vf9rr2,icuzyjq,"I set mine to chill because it does too many stupid lane changes but it continues to do them so I don‚Äôt think it makes any difference right now. 

We need a drone mode where FSD would just drone out and continue driving straight until it‚Äôs operator tells it to change lanes.  If it comes to a T intersection it should automatically make right turns not randomly decide which way to go"
vf9rr2,icumo2i,"I've been keeping mine on chill since Dirty Tesla made a video about it, and I've enjoyed the ride much more. I might switch it over to see how it has progressed since then, but it does a great job, and I don't have as many complaints from any passengers when I'm using FSD"
vf9rr2,icvpq7h,"Here is another one: Does Summon Standby mode do anything anymore, ?  since the App was updated a while back and no longer has a "" come to me "" button on the main App screen"

161w8jp,jxty85p,"I‚Äôm curious because the lane control for the Tesla I find to be good.  The keeping its distance and rapid breaking leaves much to be desired though.  At night under certain lighting conditions on 2 lane highways there still is the occasional phantom braking which after 2 years of tuning vision only should be fixed by now, or admit the radar sensors need to be added back. Also do the other car companies version of autopilot change speeds based on the speed limit signs posted?  I‚Äôve found that to have saved me a few potential speeding tickets."

161w8jp,jxug9iy,"I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôve driven a Ford, Nissan, Volkswagen, and Honda with lane keeping and all of them would either ping pong within the lanes or run on the line when the highway curves too deep. Autopilot never runs on the lines"

161w8jp,jxvm6qa,"Unfortunately I haven't seen any evidence that Tesla spends much time on an systematic competitor research except maybe on charging and battery tech. When you start to drink your own bathwater, you're getting too complacent about what's happening in the rest of the industry, and you stop being the upstart innovator."
161w8jp,jxuo7qv,"Im on my 2nd tesla. Had a 16 MS.  Never had any issues that seems to be common here.  No quality issues, no service issues, no phantom breaking, none of that.  My friends with teslas the same.  Im wondering are my friends and i lucky or what."
161w8jp,jxtzad8,"Had a rental kia and the lane keep allowed me to switch lanes by overcoming a little resistance. It never disengaged.

FSDb AP is among the best I've experienced.

The question is *if* they're going to roll out the FSDb improvements to non-FSD cars and when."
161w8jp,jxuqfmb,"Mobileye should take most of the credit here, the legacy manufacturers merely buy the system and integrate it into their products and most, if not all, are using Mobileye for TACC features."
161w8jp,jxw83et,"Hi, Former Nissan tech. We‚Äôve had that since 2013 it‚Äôs not new to the brand. Just new to the cheaper liner ups of it.

I also drive a subaru outback and had to keep forcing the car back onto the highway as it kept drifting over to every offramp"
161w8jp,jxua8jn,"And I have a brand new Nissan Pathfinder and the lane keep/cruise control system is absolute garbage.
When I got the car I used it a couple of times on road trips and it ping-pongs in the lane, and does the ""hands on wheel"" alert so much that it's useless.  
My Model Y is lightyears better."
161w8jp,jxv4r9b,"Coming from a Nissan Rogue to a Model Y, I can tell you Tesla‚Äôs AP is much better, especially when it comes to handling high speed curves. Many times my Rogue got too close to the walls where I‚Äôd need to disengage."
161w8jp,jxu8c3l,"In theory, you only need a lane keep assist for steering and cruise control with forward distance radar for acceleration and you get what you describe if both systems work well. However, this isn't a road to level 5 and doesn't even use any AI necessarily.    
What nissan does is more advanced afaik, but for highway only.   
Agree that these systems can be great, and that Tesla currently doesn't do these too well on the legacy stack."
161w8jp,jxv81pi,"100%. Autopilot was almost perfection when I bought my car in 2020. I was a gung-ho Tesla guy at that point, Autopilot was the most impressive thing ever and all around the car was perfect.

Then Tesla decided to fuck everyone when they disabled radar in our cars because ‚Äúvision only is superior and it‚Äôs easier for our poor developers to not maintain two software tracks blah blah blah‚Äù. Fuck that. They could have kept the legacy autopilot code as an option and just left it as-is. That single decision is the reason why I‚Äôll never buy another Tesla. A company that degrades functionality just because it‚Äôs easier isn‚Äôt one I want to stick with. I bought a car that had functionality that they removed. I don‚Äôt even see how that‚Äôs legal to be honest.

Just took a road trip in my wife‚Äôs 2019 Audi. Better experience than using autopilot in today‚Äôs state. Asked me in 2020? Tesla AP all day. Glad more EVs are coming on the market and Tesla is opening the supercharger network to everyone. When it‚Äôs time for a new car I‚Äôll definitely be looking elsewhere."
161w8jp,jxu04eh,">What's going on here? Is Tesla aware that Nissan and other companies are putting these superior systems in their mid level vehicles?

that has been the case for many years, people on this sub just didnt wanna believe it.

not only are the systems as good or better they also dont constantly force you to engage and disengage the system on every lane change but they also work at much higher speeds.

Teslas vision only system is limited to 160kmh meanwhile even a freaking Golf has ACC and Lane assist that drives like its on rails up to 210kmh.

that was one of the major reasons for me for not buying a Tesla, i did a few test drives and auto pilot is just overhyped as fuck and there are just too many simple features missing from the cars to be worth it."
161w8jp,jxudpjk,"Tesla has neglected everything in favor of FSDbeta. Park assist, autopark, smart summon, quality of service centers, autopilot, normal fsd. They are destroying their reputation.

It's amazing that car companies are just now catching up to more or less where tesla was years ago with autopilot. It really shows you how ahead tesla used to be. Fsd beta is really amazing, and it's definitely a next level feature. If you can afford to try fsdbeta, you definitely should, but what remains to be seen is how far other car companies will be whenever fsd beta finally reaches the production builds for normal Joe's. Outside of stolen IP by the CCP, it doesn't seem like there is anyone else close to FSD beta right now, but we'll see."
161w8jp,jxunkos,"Interestingly, my wife drives a 2022 Infiniti, the Nissan luxury brand and it uses the same ADAS and cruise control hardware as Nissan, and I can't stand that car's ""auto-pilot"".  It will constantly drift in the lane, and then give the ""take control"" warning because it can't stay in the lane.  I've had it checked and the mechanic at the dealership tells me it is operating as expected.

My son is an engineer who works in ADAS testing and has tested Nissan vehicles and claims most brands are better than Nissan. Not only in accident avoidance but also in the overall quality of the cruise control and lane-keep system.

I do not doubt that your experience in the Rogue was better than your Tesla, I just wanted to provide a counter-argument, since both your experience and mine are merely anecdotal."
161w8jp,jxu1e7j,"Radar vs vision made a big difference. 

Now, FSD on the highway merge actually improved a lot but also reversed a lot. 

And harsh braking is baaaaad

Don't worry, HW4 will bring back radar and all of us with older cars will get forgotten."

161w8jp,jxvg3rf,"Been saying this, Teslastans seem to think Tesla is the only car company with this decade old Tech. Tesla is the only company that allows it to get out of hand by giving it too much control when it shouldn't have it. They are willingly allowing the car to crash. I've tested systems from almost all manufacturers and although most don't do as much as Teslas, Teslas are the most dangerous system because they confidently do too much which leads to acciddents."
161w8jp,jxujhf3,"Other brands are surpassing Tesla, not just on AP..

Elons distractions are leading to the company‚Äôs destruction."
161w8jp,jxu3s2z,"what happens when the car in front of you comes to a complete stop for more than 2sec? I hate that in our 2020 pathfinder. it was cool until we got the tesla, which put it to shame."
161w8jp,jxuz9g7,"Yeah, most other brands have a driver assist system that‚Äôs at least comparable, and in many cases superior"
161w8jp,jxv22g6,Mercedes Benz
161w8jp,jxv2p4q,They probably utilize radar sensors.  Cameras will never be an adequate substitute.
161w8jp,jxv5fcp,"Wait until you drive a modern Kiayundai. Sold mine for a profit because I don‚Äôt like the safety risks, but I definitely believe it has the best adaptive cruise control in the non-lux market, and better than some pseudo-lux or luxury brands."
161w8jp,jxvaib3,"The OP is not wrong.  AP1 with the MobilEye stack was and remains superior with regard to lanekeeping.

Where other manufacturers will have to play catch-up is with the total package (all roads, all speeds).

But it‚Äôs more of a race than it should be.

My first two EVs were and are Teslas.  My third EV will have the best available driver assist software, charging network, build quality and service as related to TOC.

Now that Tesla has sacrificed/opened up  their SC network in the name of profit (valued at $10-$20B), that leaves driver assist features as the most obvious differentiator.

While keeping an eye upon Ford and the VW Group, I‚Äôm hopeful that the next generation of smaller Rivian truck will be the winner.

We shall see.

In the meantime, Tesla remains the least worst option *if* HW5 solves the deficiencies of HW4 that make an HW3 car with USS more desirable.

It‚Äôs a bit offputting as an owner of an HW3/USS car with included supercharging to test drive brand new 2 HW4 cars only to find that neither could drive into or out of my own neighborhood.  Meanwhile, the HW3/USS car does a decent job and even accounts for wandering dogs and jaywalking humans.  Or vice versa."
161w8jp,jxvaz6c,I rented a BMW ix3 and its also amazing.
161w8jp,jxvb1l0,"I do wonder at what point Elon‚Äôs hand is forced on either lowering the cost of EAP considerably or moving some of the features (auto lane change I‚Äôm looking at you) to standard Autopilot in order to not even stay ahead, but just keep up, with the competition."
161w8jp,jxvba9v,"I have the biggest issues in hilly terrain. If it can‚Äôt clearly see the road beyond the crest of the hill, it panics and starts slowing. Unfortunately, I live in an area with a lot of hills, so this slowing happens 6 or 7 times one way on my commute."
161w8jp,jxvn9qb,"I recently got a MYLR with EA and I am pretty disappointed. I was wondering how on earth the FSD operates, but I didn't realize it was totally different code."
161w8jp,jxvp27c,I have FSD. I had the harsh braking when someone gets in front of you. It‚Äôs almost like the car is coming to a complete stop.
161w8jp,jxvrb42,"Not only cruise control and lane keeping. I drove an Opel Corsa rental, even the auto high beams were 100x better. I didn't have the feeling of driving a Christmas tree with the lights constantly going on and off whenever there was a road sign it thinks is another car. 
5 years ago I was convinced Tesla was a technology company. Now I'm sure it's just another ordinary car maker. I would still buy another Tesla though, they have quirks, not everything is perfect, but for me it's the best car I have ever driven. And the most fun"
161w8jp,jxvw7n3,"I have both Tesla Model Y and Toyota Camry, and I must agree with you on this. My cruise control is significantly better then my Tesla model Y control. The camry adaptive cruise control is always smooth and keep the right distance from the car without heavy breaking or slowing down. Model Y have on advantage of keeping the car in the Center Lane, but it always seem to fail to keep following the car in the front with the appropriate distance. Sometime it randomly break, randomly increase speed when the car was only 2 car away ( my setting was 4), it acc and decc is not consistently."
161w8jp,jxw29nd,"They got rid of radar. It worked much better a few years ago. Sad that my car has gotten worse with age, but given the choice I'd go back to software v9 in a heartbeat."
161w8jp,jxu48ju,My Grand Cherokee trailhawk has better lane keep assist and acc than the Y I leased earlier this year.
161w8jp,jxurbhn,There is no way. I rented a rogue recently and was flabbergasted at how bad the lane keep was
161w8jp,jxuc7io,"AP is like limited code and complexity. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs free. At the same time Nissans Pro pilot or whatever the f it‚Äôs called stops there. There will be no improvements. 

So yes. With radar things can be smoother for TACC but I‚Äôve seen what FSD Beta does on the highway and if it wasn‚Äôt 20K CAD I‚Äôd buy it right away. Sadly we don‚Äôt have subscription"
161w8jp,jxu1m7r,The irony of posting this the day Elon films himself live do a 1-hour-long FSD drive.
161w8jp,jxtxy5r,"Different applications and intents. 

Legacy automakers lane keeping function is just that: lane keeping.  Its actually very easy with off-the-shelf kits from suppliers. It‚Äôs **not** built for collision avoidance or recognition of the road environment ‚Ä¶. though in some cars there might be other systems to do collision avoidance. 

Tesla Autopilot has intent of lane keeping, road environment recognition, and collision avoidance all built it via vision neural nets. Their goal eventually is something towards full automation with recognition and action of road signs, lane markings, and other driver behavior. *It‚Äôs still a work in progress.*"
161w8jp,jxu6327,"Designing a purpose-built system for a limited set of tasks is much easier than making a general-purpose system that tries to handle every situation. The Nissan is optimized for lane keep and cruise control only. It can do nothing else, which is good on the highway, bad for navigating on/off it."
161w8jp,jxuim2f,The ‚Äúemergency lights‚Äù feature that slows it down like 10-15 mph has almost got me rear ended a few times. There wasn‚Äôt emergency lights ahead of me any of those times
161w8jp,jxx5m4d,"Well I‚Äôm glad other automakers finally caught up to 2018-version-autopilot after all these years! Yes, Autopilot hasn‚Äôt been updated in 5 years‚Ä¶ only FSD means anything now."
161w8jp,jxy7080,Buy one.  No one cares.
161w8jp,jxu7std,"Best part of some of the competitive systems (BlueCruise, SuperCruise) is no steering wheel nag on the highway. 

Tesla originally promised to tackle highway autonomy before moving on to city streets. It seems at some point they abandoned that plan and are currently chasing Level 2 hands-on-wheel driving just in more scenarios."
161w8jp,jxunesn,"Lol, my dads 2023 acura tlx autopilot is fucking atrocious compared to Tesla. Lets be honest, no one is close."
161w8jp,jxu086w,Unfortunately Tesla focused on city streets instead of highway driving. As a result they are one of the few makers that does not yet have hands-free driving.
161w8jp,jxu6ogf,Honda ACC and lane keep assist is also much better than Tesla AP and has been for quite a few years now.
161w8jp,jxude5q,HW4 MYLR. Never had a vehicle with adaptive cruise before. Just rented a 2022 Audi Q3 (in Switzerland). Radar based adaptive cruise with lane keep worked much better than my basic autopilot (but still much better than cruise on my old cars).
161w8jp,jxuo0wk,"I have to agree, I had a Tesla and then I got a Mach-E and then an ioniq5 and I prefer both of their lane keeping over the Tesla autopilot. They all have their pluses and minuses but The main reason I Don't like the autopilot was the phantom brakes all the time! Never once in the Ford or Hyundai did that happen."
161w8jp,jxuru1j,Proper engineering and using appropriate sensors matters. Not everything can be fixed with software.
161w8jp,jxut4pr,I have the same experience with my wife‚Äôs KIA. Miles ahead of my Tesla.
161w8jp,jxvb1gj,Even Prius‚Äôs system is better LOL. maybe I expected too much from Tesla
161w8jp,jxviyv7,Autopilot is not FSD12
161w8jp,jxvxi90,"The ""advantage"" you described for the Rogue is what typical Adaptive Cruise Control plus Lane Centering would do. The ""phantom braking"" and ""grandma acceleration"" on AP are the results of what AP has over its competition: (over-)sensitivity towards what's happening in other lanes and (attempted) smoother driving experience. Like FSD vs Cruise, Tesla's offering appears to be behind the competition because they are aiming at the long term."
161w8jp,jxw0bjt,Wow people really don't know that they haven't iterated on autopilot for several years. FSD has many issues but at least compare it to that
161w8jp,jxwndfk,I‚Äôm
161w8jp,jxu49gq,"Every other manufacturer is gaining on Tesla quickly. I just watched a review of Ford's BlueCruise and the guy was impressed at how much improvement Ford made. It still doesn't work on all roads and highways but when it does work it's very smooth.

I think Musk is devoting more time to his other ventures and leaving Tesla behind. Over the last few years we've seen little to no  real physical upgrades - actually more deleted features! To me, these are profit driven decisions and not an improvement as Musk claims. USS have been removed and there's still no improvement to Vision. Auto park sucks more now than it did two years ago. Summon is worst too. And yet deliveries are still happening at a breakneck pace. I hate to say it but nothing will change until orders drop off the cliff."
161w8jp,jxu7sus,"Tesla autopilot works great. I've used it on multiple trips without any issues. Folks like to complain about every damn thing. Far as I know Tesla combined the autopilot stack with FSD few months back. It is conservative in accelerating once traffic moves but it'll properly maintain follow distance and do so safely. 

Your car may be forked, mine is perfect üòÅ"
161w8jp,jxu7ggv,"""Superiority"" in an extremely limited system in your use case. It sounds like the most important thing *to you* is the simple highway stuff, and other features are less so. Tesla is working in a much bigger feature set, so sub features won't be 100% enjoyable in some cases yet. But when Nissans system screws up and does something mid-stream, Nissan has nothing else close to Teslas full feature set. Tesla is getting better at the performance though. 

I know you specifically asked about AutoPilot, but when the Nissan navigated through traffic, did the auto lane change to switch to faster lanes alone, and when it exited the freeway, how long was the pause after stopping and going when the green light chime signaled it would start going again? When weaving around neighborhoods and stopping at its destination, did the system know to actually stop? Obviously nothing remotely close to this is happening in the rental, but yea, Tesla knows exactly what everyone elses system can (and can't) do, and where they need to improve."
161w8jp,jxu3ghl,"Sounds like you should trade in your Tesla for a Nissan. That's a perfectly viable solution. My daughter just got a Nissan rogue, I've driven it and am not all that impressed. But.. that's why variety is 'the spice of life ' right? Good we have options for personal preferences."
161w8jp,jxu94pj,"I don't have experience with other systems, but i really thought Tesla ""super tech company"" would be better than what i'm dealing with."
161w8jp,jxugyva,Yep. My 2023 Kia Sportage has better ‚Äúbasic‚Äù AP than my Tesla. Posted this a few times. Frustrating for a supposedly software company like tesla lol.
161w8jp,jxuiaid,"I never use autopilot. But with my old nissan, I gotta say the ap cruise control was really good too."
161w8jp,jxu56fi,Is it because of the switch to cameras from radar?  The whole cost of build issue?
161w8jp,jxun3o8,"My suggestion is to then buy a Nissan instead of a Tesla. Sounds like you will be much happier.

161w8jp,jxw6nj8,Been saying this and the Tesla kids still throw a fit when you bring up anything cheaper in conversation because Tesla is so high and mighty lmfao. Tesla is absolutely garbage and nobody can change my mind. Worked for them before and other car brands are lightyears ahead.

161w8jp,jxv7kjh,The autopilot in my 2020 long range model 3 has been near flawless. My only real gripe is that it does indeed accelerate at a grandma's pace which is super annoying.
161w8jp,jxv93uc,I thought basic AP was a stripped down version of FSD. From an engineering doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense to invest on two separate systems for the same core task. But perhaps that is indeed the case and explanation to why basic AP is decaying.
161w8jp,jxv9gq4,I just bought a 2015 P85D with MC2 and I believe AP1. It‚Äôs been great on the highway - really impressed.

161w8jp,jxvh6jc,Sitting in my Polestar rental from Hertz charging right now (at a blazing fast 38kW max which is the fastest charger near me in Mississauga Canada) and even my 8yo MS has a much much better lane keep assist.
161w8jp,jxw7fpk,"Idk if this is the case with Nissan. But my lane keep and adaptive cruise was great on my 22 Hyundai Tucson as well. But that wouldn't work on a lot of roads that Tesla AP works on. It would nope out if turns got too crazy. Worked great on the highway, but not as capable imo."

161w8jp,jxwdtqp,‚ÄúElon Musk reportedly demanded cameras over radar in self-driving cars because human eyes don't rely on radar‚Äù this should tell all you need to know about Tesla‚Äôs autopilot ability.

161w8jp,jxzkofk,"That‚Äôs interesting. I took a trip to a soccer game last night. 90% of the time it was on autopilot and I never had any issues. On the way over, I did take over for a bit because there was too much traffic and people were doing weird stuff.

161w8jp,jy04v3p,I prefer Volvo pilot assist over Tesla autopilot
161w8jp,jy17tse,I concur. I just rented a 23 M3LR and my Toyota Camry auto pilot is able to keep distance better in cruise control.
161w8jp,jy1jg83,Going from a Tesla with FSD to one with just autopilot was a shock. Even just using the FSD as autopilot it reacted much safer and more reliably. I honestly think Tesla is setting themselves up for a lawsuit if they don't sync them. Smart thing would just use the same code but prevent it from initiating lane changes or performing turns for the 'cheap' option. I've seen the autopilot on the current car do things that would have caused an accident if I hadn't taken over that the FSD in just autopilot mode handled just fine.
161w8jp,jy2m6f1,I just bought a used model 3LR and basic autopilot hasn‚Äôt worked since I picked it up. My 2018 Accord had better ‚Äúautopilot‚Äù then this Tesla. It goes in for service this week so hope I get to experience it soon. But all things considered I don‚Äôt anticipate it being any better than what Toyota and Honda have had for the last 5 years.
161w8jp,jyadg7s,Yes. Tesla was using people as Guinea pigs testing 0ut their software‚Ä¶the other companies took a more traditional route and actually had professionals QA for them.

161w8jp,jxu6qu0,"Basic Autopilot is still being updated. Since 2023.20.X it's reacting to cars cutting into your lane much quicker. And it'll use emergency braking for cars trying to side swipe you.

161w8jp,jxu9lyc,"Ive been using autopilot for 5 years now, and my major issue with using FSD beta highway stack is how much room it leaves in stop and go. It begs to be cut in front of by the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs swap lanes aggressively because it seems like this lane is moving faster, but in reality will make the same progress as others‚Äù crowd.

Other than that, I have to say it is getting really good at highway. I really think it won‚Äôt be long before everyone is on the same codebase. I might even guess by the end of the year with the holiday update. It really is in Teslas best interests to do it, diverging codebases is development (and testing) hell."
161w8jp,jxudotb,"Autopilot on HW2.5 with Radar back in late 2018-2019 was way smoother and confident. 1 Car following distance option - it was great! Albeit some of the phantom braking issues back then but it was overall better, even compared to the FSDb on Highway."
161w8jp,jxuy6i3,"I think it depends on area, socal here literally works 99.999999% I would say it stays in lane better than most 90% of regular drivers.

But AP1 is better at basic following and lane keeping, which is 99% of the job."
161w8jp,jxv9pc1,"True, but why did they have to fuck everyone that had radar already by disabling it? I don‚Äôt buy the ‚Äúmaintaining two software tracks is too hard‚Äù. 1.) there‚Äôs nothing to maintain if they simply left the vision+radar code as-is and let owners opt-in to vision only if they wanted and 2.) radar is still active to this day for HW2.5. Just let those of us with HW3 use that autopilot version as an option.

161w8jp,jxuvlu7,"I'd agree to except for bad lane changing decisions. I miss the old 'don't change lanes' option of the old highway code. Yes I know there's a 'minimize lane changes'  button, but I still have bad experiences with that on. For instance driving in the HOV lane, clear sailing ahead, 18 miles until I need to turn off the highway, and FSD decides to change out of HOV and into heavy traffic for some random reason. FSD is also too aggressive accelerating towards merging cars when lanes are coming together, but this is a less frequent event for me.

Initial v11 builds were really bad - I had a stretch of  highway I frequently drive where FSD always  insisted in moving left across multiple lanes, into HOV, even though I had to exit right in 1/2 a mile. Overall I find I am still disengaging FSD a lot more often on highways than the old AP code."
161w8jp,jxumjtl,Just did 9000 miles this summer across the country all on FSD ('22 MXP). One mild phantom brake.

Phantom braking to the point people behind me had to swerve a couple of times‚Ä¶ I realize they were following too close, but it‚Äôs not great to get honked at for something I had no control over, and just reinforces ‚ÄúTesla drivers are assholes‚Äù perception. 

It tried to change lanes into a semi at one point and then realized there was a semi there, causing it to swerve back over, all the while I‚Äôm trying to wrestle it off. 

Overall it was more nerve wracking keeping it on, than just having AP. 

That being said, my research is in CAV, so I‚Äôm probably more critical than most."

161w8jp,jxumhne,"FSD used to use the current autopilot code on the highway. With V11, they applied the FSD city streets driving code and environment awareness to the highway. The current autopilot (autosteer) is still on the same old foundation. They make minor improvements but the new environmental awareness that FSD has on the highway has not made it to regular autopilot yet.

Example: FSD today (11.3.6 and up) will lane-keep properly in the right lane on the highway even when an exit appears with no dotted lines separating it. Autopilot today will sometimes veer into the exit lane to continue ""lane-centering"" in a sort of dumb simplistic way if the gap in dotted lines is big enough. I find this behavior more pronounced at night or when approaching blind hills on single lane highways. FSD will actually understand the concept of the poorly marked exit lane and stay on track until it catches a pair of lane lines/dashes ahead.

The hope is one day the autopilot code will be updated with the FSD code. For now, I'm sure Tesla with upselling the enhanced capability üòÜ.

The thing killing me about FSD right now is the lane change behavior. I know they need to get data to make the navigation of lanes better, but damn I wished I could have just turned off any auto lane changes when I was subscribed. The ""minimal lane changes"" and ""chill"" setting didn't save me from the occasional, random, and swift lane change decisions to the left lane when there weren't any cars around to pass!! EAP has granular settings but still running on the aging autopilot code.

That said if I have a 600+ mile round trip coming, I might subscribe again. That turn signal lane change feels luxurious lol"

161w8jp,jxwmufd,"I don‚Äôt mean to be a jerk, but you‚Äôre definitely over thinking this situation. Allowing people to opt-in to vision only means that anyone who doesn't opt in would never get a software update again. And Tesla would lose the ability to push software recalls. Or Tesla would have to spend time and money maintaining software for a platform they never plan to use again. 

I‚Äôm not saying they made the right call here, but you are definitely over simplifying the situation."
161w8jp,jxwomi3,I have hw3 and recently had my car in service and my radar still says it‚Äôs active
161w8jp,jxuuaat,"From what I read years ago, radar has a lot of false positives at speeds greater than 50mph. Something like a can of coke can look like a car to the radar. So, they throw out a lot of that information and focus on the other moving objects. I think this is why the Teslas were slamming into fire trucks blocking the freeway."
161w8jp,jxwlj08,"It's not limitation of radar per-se but software interpreting. Basically software has to decide if that ""ping"" is something worth avoiding or not. It's much easier to do this with moving objects than stationary ones.

What's more radar is essentially 2.5D with a certain field of vision, if you're for example climbing up-hill and there's an overpass, it's hard to tell if it's obstacle on the road or above you.

So a lot of radar pings are ignored by the signal processor.

Having said all of that ... that's why you combine radar with vision. Radar quite nicely compensates for deficiencies in vision (eg. it judges distance order of magnitude better than vision system, works at night). And vice-versa.

""Combining data is hard"" was always a bullshit excuse to save money. Don't get me wrong ... it is hard. But it gives much better results."
161w8jp,jxuykf6,It always makes me think of Kramer in Seinfeld with the luxurious wide open lanes...
161w8jp,jxuq0zx,"That lane behavior has blown my mind for many years now. I encounter that all over all the time, and the car just had no idea what to do. Two years ago it would just swerve into the now wider lane and sit there, then it would switch to immediate take over requests, and now I think it will sometimes handle it shakily, sometimes gives up and yells. 


That's like the only highway behavior I've experienced that doesn't work. Other things work or are at worse suboptimal, this just completely breaks it."
161w8jp,jxw2gl2,"I have received a speeding ticket here in Canada when the speed went from 80 km/hr to 60 km/hr just on the other side of an intersection.  Since using the autopilot through there the car always travels the appropriate speed.  You said you doubt it saved me many speeding tickets, what did you base that statement on, do we know each other in some way because if you knew me you would know it did so I‚Äôm curious again, how did you come to that assumption?"

161w8jp,jxwgt6t,"I did a 2900 mile road trip this summer all on FSD ('19 M3 LR AWD with acceleration boost) and FSD was a *nightmare*.  Phantom braking, trying to move right into lanes that didn't exist, not being able to decide which lane to be in, trying to move over into right turn only lanes constantly when the nav was saying to continue straight.  It got a lot better when I dropped back from lead and put it on chill & minimal lane changes to just follow the vehicle in front.

The worst one was right at the end of the trip when I was sat in traffic - 4 lane highway, we were coming off on the next exit onto a different highway but there had been an accident on the highway we were going onto.  This meant there were 3 lanes of free-moving traffic, but the right lane which was exit only (and the lane I needed to be in) was stop & go traffic.  1.5 miles from the exit, while stationary (in chill mode & minimal lane changes still) it suddenly went ""moving into faster lane"" and tried to move me left into the path of traffic doing 70."
161w8jp,jxu1ueg,"Yes and no.

I haven't experienced the crippling ""panic braking"" phantom braking of production AP, but there are definitely still ""micro brakes"" every so often.

As if the car lifts off the accelerator for a second and hesitates before reapplying steady force.

It's noticeable, but infinitely better."
161w8jp,jxu1oq8,Generally yes. It‚Äôs been quite a while since I‚Äôve had a phantom braking issue.  I do about 90% or my driving on autopilot / FSD.
161w8jp,jxu2qwu,I haven‚Äôt had any phantom braking on my 2023 HW3 MY.
161w8jp,jxu1rf0,It seems much better in that respect for sure.
161w8jp,jxuol2a,"100%. 

I have standard AP but am using FSD Beta on a loaner and was shocked at how much better FSD Highway is. No phantom breaking, very efficient in regen utilization (might actually be better than maximizing regen manually tbh), quick and natural acceleration when stop traffic turns into go, and best of all no more late braking when highway traffic abruptly slows down. Standard AP reaction time is scary late. FSD Highway predicts slowdowns sooner and brakes gradually maximizing regen use unless braking becomes absolutely necessary. Super impressed with it. 

As someone considering the upgrade to EAP, I‚Äôm curious if it‚Äôs traffic awareness is closer to FSD or standard AP."
161w8jp,jxwh5wh,"I've had some severe phantom braking when doing a long road trip this summer - doing 75 down a highway and it'd suddenly slam the brakes on and take me down to 25 (it'd change the limit to 25mph).  This happened at least a dozen times in 2900 miles.  Someone mentioned to me that it could be old mapping data from when there was construction on the highway which kind of makes sense to me, but it's terrifying when it happens."
161w8jp,jxu7lyi,"It‚Äôs gotten much better since 2021, I use FSD beta all the time on the freeway.  My only gripe is sometimes the lane selection is bad but most of the time it does an excellent job on the freeway.

161w8jp,jxu6h0o,I don't think this is accurate. Never seen or heard of any other company doing surround video to any degree. All they do is 360 park assist.
161w8jp,jxuem5j,"Different. It‚Äôs a tiered system and goals of Tesla are to merge the stacks eventually. 

Autopilot can recognize and act on basic road signs and markings. FSD is the fuller suite that‚Äôs at premium pricing that can recognize and act on more road environmental cues.

I doubt there will be much improvements to the 3 and Y except maybe lighting. If they add a HUD, 360 view cameras, or rear cross traffic alerts I'll be surprised.

161w8jp,jxvcb8j,My opinion is that HW3 in a 2019 Model 3 is actually better. Occasionally it appears to try to kill me (maybe it is just daring me) but in general I think it is better than it has ever been. It probably depends heavily on where one uses it. I use it mainly on motorways/ highways and clearly marked roads.
161w8jp,jxumvt9,"On highway or streets? Turning on streets is the biggest issue with FSD imo. Slow, easily confused bc no lane paint, causes other drivers confusion bc of erratic behavior in intersections."

161w8jp,jxwous3,"What do you mean it still says it's active? If you have a current software version then it shouldn't be active for every day autopilot, but I recall reading somewhere that it's still used for some scenarios that don't include auto steer or TACC."

161w8jp,jxuoo8j,"This has been my experience as well. Not sure exactly when it happened but I haven‚Äôt had a true phantom *brake* in quite a while. I almost got rear ended because my car slammed on the brakes for absolutely no reason a while back. It kind of put me off of AP for a while. 

On the FSD stack, at worst, I‚Äôll have phantom slow downs. Rather than jarring my whole body like before, it makes me go ‚ÄúHuh, that‚Äôs weird.‚Äù"

I‚Äôm sure they are still working on improvements there but they have delivered few of them to customers over the last few years, because their focus shifted to the FSD re-writes.

Look into the details of the test and you will see why Tesla scores high, the cars are solid overall and have the same systems that basically everyone else has and in the recent tests tesla scored slightly better in assistance systems because they have an interior camera which many others dont have as its not required unless you wanna attempt level 4 autonomy which so far only Mercedes is doing."

Hence at the same time creating the Optimus robot because who knows where this will lead.

This is a continuation of a ""top down"" approach where you achieve a generic solution which then you can apply to different situations. This will be easier to achieve with Highway so I still think this will come first.

They were working on both. They suddenly realised when they opened their toolbox they were only looking at hammers. They are now creating a comprehensive set of tools. Then will come Highway. Then City Streets. Then Auto Park. Then Summon. Then Robotaxi. It's all linked.

161w8jp,jxw3an2,"It was, indeed. But do you not see the difference in realizing one‚Äôs mistake and changing their behavior vs. your framing of your actions as ‚Äúbeyond your control?‚Äù I of course see you‚Äôre trying to dunk on me, but are you really not seeing the point I‚Äôm making?"
161w8jp,jxuzc61,I guess mileage varies for some. Dog Mode and Keep Climate work well for me.
161w8jp,jxuusgq,I made no claims about what was better or worse. Only that many other carmakers have hands free systems. Tesla does not.

161w8jp,jxv7lhz,"I am asking what other incidents should I be checking out among other competitors that bolster an ‚Äòautopilot‚Äô software. I‚Äôm not aware of any other competitor (besides Mercedes w/ their level 3 autopilot software) that advertises ‚Äúautonomous driving‚Äù softwares like Autopilot. 

I am sure the Nissan rogue mentioned by OP calls it ‚Äòlane keep assist‚Äô and ‚Äòadaptive cruise control‚Äô, not ‚Äòautopilot‚Äô, which connotes something entirely different.

I am asking you (not moving the goal post) for another competitor that boasts an incomplete software that has resulted in harm."
161w8jp,jxv0093,"When did I say that? Please be specific. 
At this point I‚Äôm not even sure you‚Äôve actually read my comments."
161w8jp,jxw5tzi,"Why would you endanger lives like that?

Also, if you‚Äôre going to use quotes, I dunno, try to use them correctly?"
161w8jp,jxuzuqd,"Ah naw, the Dog Mode works perfectly, once engaged. I did however notice if the internet is a bit sketchy, that the app will say it's engaged even though it's not.

So new habit, turning it on before exiting car xD"
161w8jp,jxuwwxw,"Your reply went under my comment specifically referring to MB hands free.  Not accusing you of making any statement about which is better‚Ä¶ I was referring to the OP regarding better or worse comment but I was specifically stating your comment that MB hands free is currently available is false.   It may not even be available on the 2024 EQS which should hit shores in Oct.  

I have 150k+ miles of autopilot use under my belt.  All 3 previous teslas traded in at approx 50k miles due to warranty expiration.  It‚Äôs not great but it works well as a level 2.  IMO it could do level 3 on highways in a straight line but there are too many unique cases where it should not be used that way especially with the loss of radar and ultrasonic sensors.  FSD on the other hand should never and I repeat NEVER be approved for level 3 city use.  It‚Äôs simply awful and downright dangerous especially with a yoke 

Regarding other manufacturers, I don‚Äôt know anything about Ford‚Äôs system but last time I looked into ordering a Escalade before I ordered the model X I was told supercruise is not currently available.  When I ordered my Ford Raptor last year I was shown specific fine print stating ford‚Äôs version of autopilot would no longer be available for the raptor."
161w8jp,jxv9vx3,My VW Atlas has had a couple of phantom braking ‚Äúlife threatening‚Äù incidents. I don‚Äôt think they consider their software incomplete. I think it‚Äôs a bit irrelevant how the tech is branded or marketed.
161w8jp,jxw1wjy,Bummer. Tesla uses ATT LTE.  Hope your cellular is better.
161w8jp,jxvd6ax,"You think it‚Äôs irrelevant that one company calls it autopilot, and the others call them assists? I feel like there is an incredible difference between the two words and what consumers might understand them to be. The onus is on the producer, not the consumer.

Edit: in no way doubting your experience because VW isn‚Äôt known for their quality, but I have never had a similar experience in any of my cars."
161w8jp,jxxjel5,"I hope they don't ;)

just being snarky, we are in EU, so basically ATT doesn't exist. I am sure they are on some global contract here, so it will just take whatever there is. And sometimes it's perfect. And sometimes you're on a roadtrip and not even the music will play because, no network xD"

1cc51xo,l12wgrr,"The ""Follow"" distance thing is nuked with FSD.

You now get three profiles of ""Chill"", ""Average"", and ""Assertive"", which change the driving behavior of the car, including follow distances, with ""chill"" being the longest follow distance"
1cc51xo,l12x9r6,"Thanks.  Surprising that even the ""assertive"" profile seems to have a very long follow distance.  My wife reports that she likes the FSD driving more than me -- it's ""smoother"" and ""just a better driver.""

Suffice to say, I am now jealous and am less likely to purchase FSD.  :)"
1cc51xo,l14lite,"I can see why your wife would say that‚Ä¶ if you think assertive follows too long, that‚Äôs wild. 

Even on chill I often dislike the follow distance that the car keeps. On the highway especially I want several car lengths distance from me and the car infront, there‚Äôs almost no reason not to keep a massive gap."
1cc51xo,l13x42k,You can make the car be more aggressive by lightly tapping on the accelerator to nudge it to a higher speed.  You also have to increase the max speed allowed with the right dial button to do so.
1cc51xo,l1smcdb,"Many redditors seem to wildly underestimate the needed distance between two cars. I often see redditors recommend 6 car lengths at highway speeds.

However, the general recommendation, at least in Europe, is 2 seconds. At 120 km/h or 75 MPH, that is 14 car lengths (using the length of a Model 3). 

In many places you will get fined for too close following if you get below 1 second. At 120 km/h, that is 7 car lengths. So the reddit recommendation of 6 car lengths can actually result in a well-deserved fine."
1bxz92a,kygd3oy,"> Also at dusk when the illumination changed from light to dark, noticed the visualization would lose the lanes when FSD/cruise engaged but show the cars. If I disengaged, the lanes came back. Repeated that several times on both legs.

This sounds like your FSD computer might be having issues or something, the lane markings shouldn't go away..."
1bxz92a,kygsff7,"I just did a 24h/1400mile road trip in my 2019 MYLR; 99% of it was on FSD. Works perfectly fine day or night. The only complaint is that out in the desert at night FSD keeps thinking the side cameras are blocked and beeps every couple of minutes cuz it is so dark out either side. 

I would not have done this road trip if I wasn‚Äôt on FSD and had to stay in lanes manually."
1bxz92a,kygohkh,"I agree. As much as I love to hate viciously on Tesla's ADAS, it's much better than me at keeping track of the lane lines in dark / wet conditions. It might be a good idea to get this checked out."
1bxz92a,kyhj5c3,It seemed to me it was working.  It just didn't show in the visualization so thinking a display bug.
1bxz92a,kylrxu8,Model Y was not available in 2019.
1bxz92a,kygp5cn,"True sign of someone who likes the tech.

""Damnit, this thing sucks, but it doesn't suck *that* bad""."
1bxz92a,kygt339,"Honestly my biggest complaint is that it won't let me switch ""Smart"" functions off. I understand that it isn't perfect and I don't expect it to be. But FFS just let me make the decisions if the car cannot."
1bxz92a,kyh52i0,"Yeah, my biggest complaint is the speed limit in bad weather, especially now that they took away TACC unless you park the car and change modes.  I've used the accelerator to force it to 75 when it's self limiting to 50 without any issue and when traffic is going 75 in the rain and you're stuck at 50, that's a pretty significant danger itself. 

Tesla is still better at allowing drivers to make decisions than almost any other manufacturer I can think of but they still have odd situations that they don't allow a driver to take responsibility while still using the tools if they are working partially."
1bxz92a,kyiy9lj,Set up a different profile that has TACC enabled. That way you can just switch profiles while you‚Äôre driving and use TACC
1bofwqi,kwot46x,It took 2.5 years for the (now legacy) FSD Beta stack to replace the legacy Autopilot stack on the highway. Hopefully it won't take that long this time though.
1bofwqi,kwq2qqg,I sold my FSD car 2 years ago.  What should I know about FSD from then to now for when the trial comes out?
1bofwqi,kwrfp17,">  we‚Äôve reached the inflection point where the city streets stack is better in most ways than the legacy highway stack.

It's NOWHERE near readiness. It's arguably much worse for safety than the good old autosteering.

Also, WTF they disabled the double pull?"
1bofwqi,kwq60qu,"You‚Äôll probably be surprised how much better it is in some areas and how much it‚Äôs the same in others. Overall it‚Äôs going to be a big jump from what you experienced 2 years ago, but certainly not solved.

Single pull to activate, increased nags, automatic speed control, new auto park, and upgraded visuals will all be new to you."
1bofwqi,kwqiyit,It is much smoother and assertive. Turns and lane changes have come a long way.
1bofwqi,kx1s7wb,"It‚Äôs literally not comparable. Unless autistic, the social anxiety of using FSD 2 years ago was intolerable. I first got mine in Feb 2022. Got FSD12.3 update last week. Started using it Monday and literally used it every drive since. Complex driving in urban/hwy/urban driving. No interventions. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs several orders of magnitude above 2022 software. This version actually can be considered full self driving. You don‚Äôt use it as a novelty anymore. You use it because it‚Äôs easier and more relaxing than driving."
1bofwqi,kx1sjsg,I don‚Äôt get this. I‚Äôve been constantly disappointed with FSD in the past. It always was more of a hassle to use. This version isn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the inflection point.
1bofwqi,kx2lzp8,"No. This version is just as bad, but in different ways. It leaves a HUGE gap in front of the car when it stops (e.g. at a traffic light), it constantly switches lanes, it makes highly dangerous turns.

And the worst thing, it stopped being predictable."
12bfep7,jexn314,"Drove 500 miles on v11 yesterday and I would say its a massive step forward for comfort and safety on highways. Other than the car trying to hop in how lanes a couple times even with the setting off, I don't recall any disengagements."
12bfep7,jexc2ve,[deleted]
12bfep7,jezrwmb,I'm still sitting here waiting. Who do I call to get V11 update?
12bfep7,jezb8sx,At first I was a fan of the idea of moving over for trucks but now it drives me insane.  At least it doesn‚Äôt swerve back over right as I pass the truck.  That was basically dangerous.  But at this point I‚Äôd just like the thing to stay planted in the middle of the lane.
12bfep7,jexb0rm,FSD is starting to drive like a human
12bfep7,jexrzra,"For me, regular autopilot will move over within lane for a large vehicle"
12bfep7,jeycl6w,"The time between nags definitely seems to be longer, a much-welcomed addition.  I've also really appreciated how FSD handles highway driving.

I will say, the ""hugging"" effect sometimes goes a bit far.  I was on a 4-lane city street with no turning lane in Austin, in the left lane (right next to the oncoming traffic), and when I passed a large utility truck, the car would veer over to almost be partially in the opposing lane, only to pop back if an oncoming car got too close.  That is a bit unsafe and unsettling, for both me and the oncoming driver.  I would think logic dictates that a car next to you, staying in their lane, is less of a threat than a car coming at you at a combined 60mph.

(I've also noticed that v11 will drive right into a bike lane when stopping at an intersection that it needs to turn right at, and then do a weird hard left swerve, then turn right when it makes the turn.  Definitely something it shouldn't do.)"
12bfep7,jezzlbz,"If FSD is now using the internal camera to assure you are paying attention, perhaps Tesla negotiated a less aggressive nag with respect to the steering wheel?"
12bfep7,jey6eqs,"I did some highway driving over the weekend and I was very impressed. We also need to bias away from being in the blindspots of other cars, then it would be supreme."
12bfep7,jfcku86,"I agree somewhat. My experience driving from Sacramento to Medford was great except for the hugging too close to the left line when passing. This caused the car to run over raised or indented markers. A margin of two or three more inches to the right would have been perfect. Fine tuning the left bias would be a welcome improvement. 

I was really impressed about how it efficiently adjusted speeds for curves."
1dmnt8u,l9wxe0z,Dunno.  Drive me from driveway to driveway from Bay Area to Monterey in weekend traffic with zero interventions quite comfortably.
1dmnt8u,l9wsv6m,"I‚Äôve been using it since the free trial and while not perfect, it‚Äôs pretty damn good. 

I just took my dad to a restaurant 30 minutes a few towns over. Very densely populated area, lots of people on the road and a mix of city and highway. Went from outside my house to the restaurant parking lot intervention free. Blew his mind."
1dmnt8u,l9wttdm,"you should have your cameras checked, that doesn't sound normal and isn't the vast majority of people's experience with v12, almost sounds like one or couple of your cameras are out of alignment or having issues"
1dmnt8u,l9wyxhe,"LOL. Tell us how you really feel! ;) What version FSD and which car? I have been using FSD on two different cars for a couple of years now and have never seen the blocked camera issue (HW3 & 4). Have you checked the system status in service mode for errors or warnings?   
  
Like many others, v11 made me nervous, particularly on 2 lane roads. I now have 12.3.6 on two cars. It is much better. It isn't perfect, but it is very good. I mainly use FSD on 2 lane roads and on the freeway and have been satisfied with its performance (other than the stupid lane change behavior in the last version or two). I have only had minor issues with the auto speed limiter. As to the school zone, I haven't noticed it, but I don't ever recall using FSD in school zones. I will have to try it and see. I guess it comes down to expectations and to where someone lives. It seems like some areas have better experience with FSD than others."
1dmnt8u,l9x9c6g,"Just in case you are unaware, you can turn off the Auto Speed setting and go back to normal set speeds when using FSD. Check under autopilot settings. Otherwise, as other people have suggested, I would recommend checking/cleaning your cameras as a next step."
1dmnt8u,l9x9zem,"I‚Äôve been using it for almost every drive and except  accelerating faster than I would like it has been pretty amazing.  

Obviously it has issues but nothing crazy."
1dmnt8u,l9xbapu,I thought the free trial was pretty impressive tbh. I didn't have any of the issues you've described.
1dmnt8u,l9wwvek,You gotta be trolling or hate Elon.
1dmnt8u,l9x5s82,It‚Äôs not. Just naggy
1dmnt8u,l9x7va5,"Yes. 
You lose instant credibility when leading with such extreme hyperbole. 

It has it's flaws, yes, and plenty of them. But it also does many things very well. To call it complete trash is to say it doesn't at all work, ever, in any situation. After 2 road trips of 2000 miles each with FSD engaged over 90% of the time, I'd be willing to go out on a limb and say it works well for the most part. Lane changes still needs work for sure. Driving on city streets is not a perfect experience by any means, but it's a vast improvement from V11.x. Auto Park, while slow AF, does a pretty good job centering between the lines, but it should also be trying to center between the vehicles on either side which it does not do. On the whole, I'd say FSD V12.6 receives a B+ grade. Honestly, my biggest complaint about FSD is that if I have it selected in my menu, I'm not able to use just regular TACC. I'm not sure why Tesla implemented this (other than people thinking they're in FSD when really they only engaged TACC), but it's maddening. I'd rather stick to FSD on highways/freeways, and use TACC on surface streets."
1dmnt8u,l9xm6ig,you're getting down votes from the super fans that cant take any criticism. ALL of this is true. you're not alone in this experience.
1dmnt8u,l9wxux2,You should follow Dan O‚ÄôDowd on Twitter.
1dmnt8u,lahgv7y,"Hey, a few things. First the auto speed offset feature is not worth turning on. With it off you can manually set the offset with the right scroll wheel, and it auto adjusts relative to the current speed limit and other conditions anyway. As you say the auto offset is often inappropriate, and I see a net gain by turning it off. 

Second if it is telling you your cameras are occluded they are likely occluded‚Ä¶ it is not just that it is dark out. You need to spray them with water and clean them with a microfiber cloth. Rain especially makes them worse."
1dmnt8u,l9xet43,i can't verify your claims but i appreciate your pain. this was a really well written post
1dmnt8u,l9ycm1v,"I sort of felt the same way about the auto speed limit feature. Had to turn that nonsense off. I don‚Äôt understand why we lose the ability to manually override the speed when using FSD. Another odd behavior was in Chicago it would read speed limit signs meant for Semis. I couldn‚Äôt use FSD or Autopilot on that trip without the car randomly reducing speed to obey those signs. 

The night time driving was a bit hit or miss for me too, but during the day it was pretty flawless. I had similar warnings on dark country roads in Iowa. 

The one other thing I didn‚Äôt like was the fact that you lose adaptive cruise control. I much prefer single pull to be cruise control and double pull to be autopilot/FSD. Sometimes I want to drive the car, sometimes I don‚Äôt. Shouldn‚Äôt have to pull off the highway and adjust the settings."
1dmnt8u,l9yz818,"It‚Äôs not trash, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs about 20% better than v11. My opinion at least."
1dmnt8u,l9x4now,"I always laugh at these posts. 

A car is capable of driving itself for hours without any intervention to get you from A to B and somehow that‚Äôs still not good enough. 

Go use another companies self driving car and report back on how that goes for you. Hint; there‚Äôs literally nobody that‚Äôs anywhere close to what Tesla FSD can do. 

Is it perfect? Nope - but it‚Äôs called supervised FSD, so as long as you‚Äôre able to correct any of its issues it‚Äôs an incredible technology. 

Also if you hate it so much, don‚Äôt use it."
1dmnt8u,l9xoes5,"Ya, FSD is pretty dangerous off the highway.  And it embarrassing much more frequently.

On the highway it‚Äôs useful, similar to all the other L2 solutions."

1dmnt8u,l9x85ci,"Yeah I think OP has some hardware issue or something, mines been great"
1dmnt8u,la0a4i7,"I've driven accross the country try twice, coast to coast, all over California, norcal specifically, cities, rural areas, night, day.  I think OP has a hardware issue or they live in the middle of nowhere. 

I found that rural areas consistantly don't work. Maps are not accurate, speeds are not accurate, lanes are weirdly painted or you get non standard marking causing issues.

 Fsd works about 99% of the time for me"
1dmnt8u,l9wx0ac,"For me it also doesn‚Äôt work on dark roads. I mean interstates, miles from the nearest city, without any street lights, when there are no other vehicles around, and it‚Äôs the middle of the night. It‚Äôll throw up FSD degraded warnings, and then refuse to switch lanes. If I disengage and manually switch lanes it won‚Äôt let me turn FSD back on until I find some light, either some other vehicles headlights or on a rare overpass or interchange that has some lighting."
1dmnt8u,l9x2s77,"FSD has never honored school zone speed limits, or recognized and stopped correctly for school busses."
1dmnt8u,l9xblcs,"I bought a month of FSD for a 50 hour road trip across the country, and I can confirm. It was much better when I had it last in December. It literally just shut off when it was dark or rainy"
1dmnt8u,l9xmajt,or its legitamate criticism and you are unable to accept that it is.
1dmnt8u,l9xz1ad,Yeah I made similar comments in another post and got downvoted to oblivion lol.¬†
1dmnt8u,l9y0zwn,I wonder if OP needs to do a camera calibration. He's the only person I've seen say FSD can't stay centered in a lane.
1dmnt8u,l9x1xh7,How on earth is the dream of the robotaxi supposed to work if the cameras don‚Äôt have the dynamic range to see well at night?
1dmnt8u,l9wxc1a,"yeah i have seen **that** before, when it's literally pitch black and nothing but your headlights are on... don't know how they gonna fix that but that does happen

I wonder if they are eventually going to retrofit a new repeater camera module that has a light on it or something for this, we'll see, or maybe they'll illuminate with the turn signal for when it wants to switch lanes"
1dmnt8u,l9x6n4z,I thought that I had heard something about that a while back. That is such a high profile item that I am surprised that they haven't resolved that issue yet. Not stopping for a school bus is 100% unacceptable.
1dmnt8u,l9xdbds,I have it on my Model Y and it‚Äôs worth every penny. I use it in Miami where the drivers are probably the worst in the country
1dmnt8u,l9xqluo,"Using language like ‚Äúhot garbage‚Äù, ‚Äúworthless goobers‚Äù, and comparing it to someone‚Äôs personal GitHub project or drunk uncle isn‚Äôt criticism. Nice try being a Good Samaritan that didn‚Äôt read OPs post"

qfwj20,hi2fnxo,"I wouldn't say my experience with average setting was good but it didn't suck. It is intriguing and you can see the future potential in it. In the limited situations I used it I was impressed by the advancement of the AP system since I got FSD in 2019. 

&#x200B;

Somethings are still a little concerning like how it sped up so fast after making a turn into a parking lot. The turn into the lot was awesome though."
qfwj20,hi2hn3l,Looks like the sane drivers got the beta!
qfwj20,hi30gbn,"Assertive is definitely needed here in the SF Bay Area. Chill is still pretty aggressive at times too. Leaving it on assertive, it feels the most human like out of the three. I like when it zooms out of the turns / corners especially."
qfwj20,hi2k7xm,"Probably too early to tell but it looks like it doesn‚Äôt really break down by FSD setting (except maybe assertive being too aggressive).  For those that had a crap experience, were you dense city or suburban heavy or other?"
qfwj20,hi2rsy0,"I mean‚Ä¶they all suck? Because the software is cool and all, but it largely sucks‚Ä¶?"
qfwj20,hi2geax,"I wish their verbiage was a little better. ""rolling stops"" is really vague"
qfwj20,hi2jsnb,Was thinking the same.  Actually something in between chill and average without the rolling stops would work well for my area.
qfwj20,hi3u2gw,Not sure why you‚Äôre being down voted.  The bad experiences are often more useful for troubleshooting progress than the good ones.  Care to elaborate and share the context of your your bad experiences?  Was it dense city traffic?  Atypical intersections?  Curious to know.  Perhaps these are things others can crowdsource/test.  This is why we‚Äôre in the FSDBeta.
13rupir,jln3em3,You have it on drunk mode. Put it back to assertive.
13rupir,jloj1iv,"I‚Äôd agree with ya but I didn‚Äôt want to waste my money on a Beta so I couldn‚Äôt tell ya.  From the wording, I‚Äôd probably do it too. üòÇ"
13rupir,jlqdnlt,"Yes, this is a known bug for a while now, still happening in v11: https://youtu.be/D1NeuNMuuDg

It has to do with some lights having a different refresh rate than the cameras, FSD Beta thinks are blinking reds instead of solid red."
13rupir,jlmfg6g,Meant to say FSD Beta
13rupir,jlmlju1,Only if it's trying to turn right on red (when it will creep even if there is obviously cross traffic still coming and creeping makes it block the crosswalk).
13rupir,jvtaq1z,"My Tesla Y with most recent updates has been taking off into intersection on a red light. It has already made a full stop and no plans for right turn when it just takes off into the intersection. It wants to kill me, but Y?"
13rupir,jwcse3k,Recently EMusky stated that Teslas has developed  AGI (artificial general intelligence) üòµ‚Äçüí´-  that might explain why it drives like a crazy teenager and wants to kill me??? üò¨üò¨üò¨

13rupir,jvv46f6,Yes that is still happening for me as well.
13rupir,jlmndjm,"Okay.  Discussions like this never really go anywhere without a video.  The best you can do is disengage and give Tesla a voice annotation.  I did that for months at some trouble spots, and they eventually got better."
13rupir,jlrd8x8,It happen 5 times and I have a video on each. Seems though I got my answer. Is a bug :(
1ccg6hp,l15d2by,Totally agreed on the lane changes. Exit in 1 mile and the car in front of you is going 3 under the speed limit? CHANGING LANE! Oops missed your exit sorry.
1ccg6hp,l15eia8,"FSD immediately tries to change lanes when it‚Äôs turned on which is very off putting, also it doesn‚Äôt do a good job of knowing which turning lane to be in for the next turn."
1ccg6hp,l15s7ea,"I brought up the lane change issue years ago when it was still EAP.  Could never understand why the car would move out of the exit lane (with less than a quarter mile to go) to pass a slower car, only to try and get back over to the exit lane and completely fucked it up because now there's no space to squeeze in and the exit lane marker is now solid color.  5yrs later and it hasn't changed."
1ccg6hp,l15jspi,Summon has never worked for me.  It‚Äôs not available on Vision cars anyway so most of us can‚Äôt even play with it.  The rest of FSD has been pretty reliable for me.  I select minimize lane changes and keep it on average.  If it goes too slow I nudge it a bit with the accelerator pedal.  If I get into a complex road scenario I just turn it off.
1ccg6hp,l15m2aa,Smart Summon hasn't changed since it came out in 2019... Neither has regular summon.
1ccg6hp,l16iwq2,"Standard Autopilot is great, but FSD is only a liability that will damage Tesla in the long run. I wish they were a car company again."
1ccg6hp,l15klnx,But everyone else is saying it‚Äôs the greatest ever update. Someone‚Äôs lying‚Ä¶
1ccg6hp,l15i8e0,Can‚Äôt forget the summon problems too. I have a video of my car trying to literally cut through the parking lot by driving through the concrete planters
1ccg6hp,l15r6as,"Or it can do what mine did. Changing lanes for faster traffic, and end up in a left-turn only lane at the next light when the route wants it to go straight, so it just... goes straight from the left-turn lane and nearly runs the traffic in the straight lane off the road before I take over.

Another time it switched to a faster lane and then needed to get back over but there was a car in the blind spot, the red warning light was on, and it decided the best course of action was to slam the brakes in 50mph traffic to try and force its way over. 

At some point it's got to just accept that it's missed the turn and go around another way."
1ccg6hp,l15mwar,The issues the FSD has are not even in complex road scenarios. Summon definitely worked when I had it. If you‚Äôre a newbie you must have only had a chance to experience what ever update(s) jacked it up.
1ccg6hp,l15m6f9,Yes it has. I never had my car drive off road using smart summon until this update. Plenty of other posts about this too.
1ccg6hp,l15lzha,Lol who is everyone? Do you have a Tesla and do you use FSD?
1buanmc,kxrmby6,"I was excited to try it.  Turned it off after the very first drive. 

Constant anxiety over how it‚Äôs going to handle each situation.  Impressed with its ability to adapt to the situation but there‚Äôs just some things I wouldn‚Äôt expect it to understand.  Morning commute by my house has a long early straight only lane that‚Äôs not marked in advance so it wanted to get ahead by going there.  Unfortunately the police like to camp there and ticket anyone trying to use it as a cut off lane so I had to stop it and I‚Äôm sure it would never figure that out. I wouldn‚Äôt expect it to.  Either way Im more comfortable with freeway only autopilot"
1buanmc,kxrotvp,"I don‚Äôt like FSD all that much after trying it. It‚Äôs neat but I don‚Äôt like having to babysit it, I‚Äôd rather just drive and use regular autopilot on the highway when I need to. 

I do have to ask why you would let the car come to a complete stop on the freeway or when it came to a complete stop in that protected right turn lane. You can override FSD by hitting the accelerator. This is especially important when it does something stupid on the highway like coming to a stop."
1buanmc,kxrob4o,"Yeah it confirmed if  V12 is what the influencers are calling AMAZING, I wonder what the older versions are like haha. I just don't think there's utility value for this thing for most consumers at $200/month or $12,000."
1buanmc,kxrv0jr,"It's kind of funny, for a while, it seemed like only the rich people here who had $12k-$15k to blow on a novelty were the only people complaining about how bad FSD is, but now that everyone has it, it's even more obvious how terrible it is. All this hype and exclusivity probably helped make it more desireable to certain people, and it seems this free trial is going to do nothing but reaffirm to most people that they made the right decision not to buy it. Robo-taxi's are a very, very long way away.

Edit: FSD driving with two wheels in bikes lanes pretty much ensures I'm never going to use it during this trial. Likely to kill someone."
1buanmc,kxronvr,"I tried FSD for a 200km round trip, mainly highway. I was on edge alot. I didn't enjoy how late it made turns, which then made the turn feel ""jerky"" I'd say. I also didn't agree with some of its iffy lane changes or turn timings when at an intersection.

There were a few times I had to intervene and learnt to always keep my foot hovering over the accelerator/brakes depending on the scenario. I think it's pretty Fucking cool that my car is able to drive on its own but being pretty fucking cool doesn't help when the system caused some potentially dangerous situations. 

I won't use it often but I think with advancement it'll be something I'd look at again. 


For now, I feel the exact same as you. Autopilot does what I like for highway driving."
1buanmc,kxrsrop,Just took a 6 hour roadtrip mostly highway and loved it. Handled twisties better than autopilot and enjoy auto lane changes. More relaxing drive than when I normally do it with autopilot.
1buanmc,kxrg7xp,"I keep my foot hovering over the accelerator pedal. I‚Äôve had to push it to make the car go while still remaining in FSD. 

Definitely push the button and give feedback. It may help get this FSD thing working better."
1buanmc,kxsw98z,"It sounds like the hope was giving people a free trial would drive sales of it afterwards for $12k a pop, but instead people are realizing how bad it is‚Ä¶ this may backfire for Tesla."
1buanmc,kxs5tc4,"It‚Äôs unusable. Elon‚Äôs ‚Äúpeople don‚Äôt realize how good it is‚Äù BS is super irritating. No we understand it is basically useless, he doesn‚Äôt understand how fucking terrible the wipers are."
1buanmc,kxs0mov,"If they update TACC to slow down more gracefully like how real people drive, I'll be happy with my car. Don't care about fsd because no matter how good it becomes, I'd still rather drive my car"
1buanmc,kxs5ljg,The update seems to be smoother and very beneficial on the highway but couldn‚Äôt imagine paying 12k for it
1buanmc,kxrlxtl,I'm so glad I didn't have to spend money on this to find out that its hot garbage.
1buanmc,kxrrpz1,Can totally relate. I‚Äôve had a few near misses with the FSD and had to turn it off to use the Autopilot..
1buanmc,kxrwfex,"Same experiences‚ÄîI was really surprised and felt like an outlier at first due to so, so many positive reviews from people. Turned it off after a couple attempts and back to Autopilot. Self park and auto lane change are awesome, but FSD was a let down and felt like it regressed since my last experience with it."
1buanmc,kxry2al,"FSD city driving is still very rough.  Basic autopilot is good, and using FSD to change lanes on the highway is fine.  Even the auto parking works pretty well.  But that‚Äôs about it."
1buanmc,kxs93wo,"I heard from my cousin about it stopping suddenly on the freeway from 60mph. I don‚Äôt like that it wants to drive in the middle lane on surface streets even though the turn is coming up soon, then it changes lane suddenly. Among other things. I agree, feel the same."
1buanmc,kxseehz,"Few observations during my trial period:

1. when taking right turn, it almost hits the kerb or it feels like it will rollover and I had to take control
2. Have humps in my community, it just drops too slow. Also, there is one covered manhole where it completely stopped thinking it is some ditch
3. Let's say I am driving in 55 MPH road, when I am driving, I slow down when road takes turns but car seems not to understand turns and doesn't slow down to avoid car running out of road.
4. Keeps wiping my windshield dry every often to clear it's camera. This is awkard, running wiper when there is no rain.
5. It scares when merging into a highway .. I am not confident it will merge seamlessly and I take control"
1buanmc,kxss54l,It's funny seeing everyone have the realization that it's a complete scam.
1buanmc,kxt2ici,just fix the wipers please‚Ä¶.   then i will consider letting the car drive itself.  it cant wipe itself yet thoüôÉ
1buanmc,kxrya9q,"""*In addition to this, the car randomly came to a complete stop while driving on a 65 MPH Freeway, while cruising at around 70 MPH, with moderate traffic all around.*¬†""  How would you even let it slow down below 50 MPH let along fully stop.  That is too dangerous and it would be on you if you or anyone else were hurt or killed."
1buanmc,kxrso9k,"I had several issues:  


1. Multiple lane roundabouts - switches lanes mid roundabout every time.   
2. Almost clipped the curb three times, maybe it wouldn‚Äôt but I yanked the wheel over to avoid a costly mistake.  
3. It merged onto a public road, well lit and with good painted lines. Car decided to stay so far to the right it was over the white line.   
4, Not sure what happened on this one. Was letting it drive home and it just decided to completely miss the exit and continue to drive straight past my turn. Not sure where it wanted to take me.   
5. It‚Äôs extremely slow through intersections and when pedestrians are present. I get that it‚Äôs cautious but it causes the situation to be more difficult than needed. When The car doesn‚Äôt move, the pedestrian or other vehicle traffic then decide to go since I am not moving. This causes confusion and near misses when the Tesla does decide to go after a long pause."
1buanmc,kxrv42y,Did fsd prior to this free month include feedback when disabled? It is nice to but definitely not life changing as I built it up to be. Still better than any other car I‚Äôve driven. Maybe my expectations were it would cure cancer and drive insanely good.
1buanmc,kxs6kxd,"I'm the outlier I guess. I was actually pretty impressed with FSD on a couple of hours round trip on both surface roads and interstate. The couple times I disengaged were primarily my own uncertainty versus fear of certain death. 

One random attempt to stop because of a weirdly placed traffic signal and if anything I was annoyed at how often it tried to pass other cars on I-95. 

I don't think it's anywhere near full self driving, but at least so far I would probably pay $100 a month for it."
1buanmc,kxsjglq,2022 MYLR. I still don‚Äôt have it
1buanmc,kxsw15r,"Id prefer if it would train somewhat on MY driving, it would be better at the roads I drive too."
1buanmc,kxtk8k2,"It‚Äôs bold for Elon to go forward with this mass trial program, I‚Äôll admit that. Whether it‚Äôs his attempt to gather a massive amount of training data or to entice potential FSD buyer. I highly doubt the latter is what the result will be. What I see is it‚Äôll only have a negative impact on the true FSD capability. It‚Äôs definitely far from what he have been promising the world all these years."
1buanmc,kxtqkjb,"Regular AP needs updates badly! Not sure if it‚Äôs AP or map data but my god does it still have incorrect speed limits on a highway the construction has been done for years now‚Ä¶ cruising at 70mph, then bam speed limit change to 45mph. FUCK!

Also, see multiple sections with floating invisible traffic lights in the visuals."
1buanmc,kxty33i,Definitely needs some work but for me I live very rural it hasn‚Äôt tried to kill me yet lol
1buanmc,kxtyybb,Works great when you don‚Äôt have to worry about any traffic. Which is the ultimate problem.
1buanmc,kxvli8a,"I feel the same as you.  Condensation on cameras sometimes causing messages.  Some random ‚Äòtake the wheel immediately‚Äô for no clear reason(no warning).  Lane changes at weird times.  Missing items on the road like a big raccoon I had to steer around at the last second.  

Im sure it‚Äôs fine in lots of places;but fog, dark, rain, construction, debris‚Ä¶.just doesn‚Äôt seem ready for these things‚Ä¶and I feel a lot more comfortable watching out for hazards than trusting the car."
1buanmc,kxsh746,"Sounds like you have been in a cave for a couple of years.  FSD is CAUTIOUS.  It doesn't like running yellow lights and it is forced to come to a complete, unmoving stop by law. 

Also, you are still the driver.  If you don't like the way it's driving give the juice petal a little pressure and it will go."
1buanmc,kxt6tpq,My experience been excellent. I just let the car do whatever it wants as long as its safe. I am not in a rush to get to my destination
1buanmc,kxreh5j,"If the car is causing panic attacks that prevent you from reacting quickly, you may need to re-evaluate your purchase."
1buanmc,kxrrojr,What year is your Tesla? I‚Äôve noticed that those with the USS loves it and had a great experience with FSD vs those without USE.
1buanmc,kxt15rn,"Same.

I only use it to fuck around with when there are like no other cars on the road.

Today it slammed from 40 to 20 because it saw a school zone 20mph sign, at 9pm. 

The thing it does most human like is the acceleration from a red light once it turns green. Feels pretty good. Totally not $12k good."
1buanmc,kxsa61s,"Same deal. They're calling it supervised instead of beta but it is very much beta software. I've done beta testing and I could bugzilla 5 different breaking bugs/bad training points in the first 3 minutes including total failure cases. That's not just supervised, that's broken."
1buanmc,kxvc2sk,"It likes lane changing away from the appropriate lane close to where you need to make a turn in a congested area. I have been honked at or flipped the bird on 2 of the 3 times I've tried FSD. No way I'm paying $12k for it!

Have not tried it on the highway yet and would like to give it a try there. Tesla is the leader of hype in this space, but I had an Audi rental last summer that had better adaptive cruise control and lane keeping than my Y."
1buanmc,kxrzfgb,">would let the car come to a complete stop on the freeway

I wouldn't let it. It just slowed down drastically from 70 to under 20 in a second, I wasn't even expecting it as there was no hazard in the lane we were in and we were at least 10 miles from exit. I immediately took control before it stopped. But had I not interfered there's a high probability it would have stopped.

>when it came to a complete stop in that protected right turn lane

I let it stop, as that was literally my very first FSD drive and was still figuring things. Also, the road was empty and felt safe to let it be. And once I realized it's not going to move, I took control.

>You can override FSD by hitting the accelerator.

I learnt it after my 3rd of 4th drive with FSD"
1buanmc,kxsblfq,Does autopilot or auto-steer on highway have the same phantom brake issue?
1buanmc,kxvwksr,"Complete agree with ""I‚Äôd rather just drive and use regular autopilot on the highway when I need to.""

The thing that it really gets me is the unpredictability. Basic AP is not perfect but it's predictable, and I know when I need to take over or when to let the car handle it. FSD presents itself to be way more capable than it actually is, unfortunately, so the line between should I take over or should I let the car handle it becomes much blurred."
1buanmc,kxv9z4y,"For real! I just got my MYLR and I am not terribly impressed with v12 FSD. I can‚Äôt really fathom why anyone would pay ANY amount for this, never mind $12k."
1buanmc,kxu72s9,"Update: drove from DC to BWI for a flight this am. FSD was essentially autopilot that changed lanes for me when I threw my blinker on. This is worth 6-12k? I'm not sold on $200/mo. I'm not sure I'd pay $25-$50/mo. I've taken two 2000mi road trips with only Autopilot, and it, for the most part, gave me near identical value as FSD on the highway."
1buanmc,kxscuem,"i read an article a few years ago that one of the first developers of self driving, that levandowski dude who got into the mud with trade secrets, concluded that self driving vehicles wouldnt happen in his lifetime on the street.  too many variables.  hes focusing on constructiom sites.  agree with that"
1buanmc,kxrs3pv,The problem is why would people pay for something they have to stay hyper vigilant to supervise. It‚Äôs not more relaxing. It‚Äôs a fun toy though.¬†
1buanmc,kxrzo9e,"After two days with it, my mean-time-between-interventions is in the single-digit minutes.

I live in a small city in the Midwest with pretty tame traffic.

That said, it‚Äôs a big improvement over the version of FSD that I used in December 2022.  It‚Äôs finally to a ‚Äúteaching a teenager how to drive‚Äù level of oversight, but nowhere near ‚ÄúI can relax‚Äù.

*P.S. One of Tesla‚Äôs marketing fuckups is that the ‚ÄúFSD Visualization‚Äù that comes with ‚ÄúAutosteer (Beta)‚Äù doesn‚Äôt show enough detail to be able to make any decisions, while the ‚ÄúFSD Visualization‚Äù that comes with this FSD (Supervised)‚Äù shows almost enough detail to be able to drive.  Showing the more detailed version of the visualization to people who haven‚Äôt bought FSD would make the case to those of us who had written it off after renting it.*"
1buanmc,kxsv59p,"Highway driving is still v11.

I want my 12k back, but I wont get it, so may as well help improve it.

The pricing is very wrong."
1buanmc,kxtnlqb,Try 6 hrs on city streets in a metro area. That‚Äôs where it should count.
1buanmc,kxs10j7,Same as AP. I accelerate to help it along tough spots.  I feel like it learns based on my driving habits.  It eventually smooths out.  Works great for me
1buanmc,kxtnc2g,"Not sure if everyone realizes this, but Elon‚Äôs decision for this mass trial program was based off some random twitter suggestion sent to him. Not a strategic business decision for a CEO of a multi billion dollars company."
1buanmc,kxsy1vq,üòÇüíØ
1buanmc,kxu2h9d,"Fully agree. TAAC to start slowing down earlier and a more gradual and gentle acceleration when the traffic starts moving. 

I would rent occasionally FSD just for the fun. Resto of the time I would indeed drive the car my self. 

Though I would pay some value for the auto parking üòá"
1buanmc,kxvwb00,Do you own a Tesla?
1buanmc,kxsvt98,"Its not garbage... its amazing tech.  Stop trolling.

But its not ready yet."
1buanmc,kxshwmn,Yeah he sounds like he should sell his car.
1buanmc,kxte770,"Was driving in the express toll lane and traffic was initially moving about 60 mph. The closest car about 1/10 of a mile ahead. For no apparent reason FSD hit the brakes. I gave it gas, then it did it again, and I gave it gas, then it did it for a 3rd time.  I disengaged it and I was at 35 mph. By then the closest car in front of me was at least 1/4 of a mile ahead.  The people behind me were on my bumper.  

Today it was going to turn left and it straddled the left lane and the next one, until I disengaged.  The lane stripe was in excellent condition and was a 10 inch wide white line. 

Making a left turn at a three-way stop, it accelerated to 29 mph before it was 75% through the turn, only to immediately let off the gas because the speed limit was 30 mph, and it‚Äôs been 45 mph for years.  

On the highway it reminds me of 16 year old in week three of driving.  So I treat it that way.  In the city it‚Äôs like a 15 year old on week two.  Very unpredictable and requires hyper vigilance."
1buanmc,kxtkwfu,"If it drives slower and more cautious than everyone else on the road, then it doesn‚Äôt belong on the road with everyone else. Unless it strictly stay in the slow lane going the speed limit. The true test of any autonomous machine is if it can act and behave like us, at least or better."
1buanmc,kxtmvll,"Good for you, but the rest of us do have places to be most of the time. Might as well stay off the road and take public transit then."
1buanmc,kxtnotd,"I have USS, OP experience is about the same with mine. It‚Äôs not ready for the masses, not at that price."
1buanmc,kxt35p3,The realistic acceleration was a pleasant surprise for sure
1buanmc,kxskf7i,I‚Äôve seen both supervised and beta. Wonder if it‚Äôs location based or A-B testing. Mine says beta still.
1buanmc,kxv01l8,"Even if it's not labeled beta, it's only level 2. I don't believe they've attempted to certify it level 3 or higher, or even in the process of doing so"
1buanmc,kxsbv1t,Fortunately for me I have not experienced phantom braking when I used regular autopilot on the highway.
1buanmc,kxshnjb,Some of the phantom breaking has to do with the camera calibration. ¬† I calibrated mine when I first got it and then had a long road trip cross country. ¬† On the way it was doing phantom breaking constantly. ¬†Even regular cruise control was unusable. ¬† ¬†At the charger someone told me to recalibrate the cameras and it hasn‚Äôt phantom breaker since. ¬† I‚Äôm not sure what the difference between attempts was. ¬†
1buanmc,kxsvkya,Machine learning is a whole other thing he wasnt familiar with
1buanmc,kxrs5t7,Fully agree
1buanmc,kxs1hm0,"That‚Äôs what I decided after I rented it in December 2022.

The building blocks were sophisticated, but the practical benefit was about the same as Honda Sensing.

I‚Äôve been driving FSD v12 for two days, and I‚Äôm not sure if it beats the ‚ÄúI can relax more than when I‚Äôm using Honda Sensing‚Äù threshold.  It‚Äôs hard to predict what FSD is going to do at this point, so no relaxation here!"
1buanmc,kxuql9b,I think it‚Äôs clear at this point that Elon does not make strategic decisions.
1buanmc,kxvyta1,I do.  MYLR
1buanmc,kxsw1mz,"If its not ready how is it not garbage with a $12,000 price tag?  I'd be a bit more forgiving if it were $2,000 and I'm definitely not trolling.  I would gladly pay for it if it actually worked all the time but as it is, it's like letting my 13 year old drive who has only ever played Forza."
1buanmc,kxtaqro,It‚Äôs garbage for the price Elon is asking for.
1buanmc,kxtxzjh,And when it's a level 5 all your complaints would be warranted.   But it's a level 3 so you're pissing up a rope.
1buanmc,kxw6yup,Damn that sucks. It literally drove me to the mall while I was eating a burger and not once did I get nervous about a turn or lane switch. lol
1buanmc,kxt1du9,Neither have I but I am constantly worried about it and hover my foot on the accelerator. Especially on newer highway stretches that I haven‚Äôt experienced many times.
1buanmc,kxw5l64,All I see on your account is you owning a non-tesla EV... Just thought I would ask
1buanmc,kxt3eh8,"You can see a teenager learing, you dont see your car learning.

Your car makes a mistake, it will make it again and again until someone else updates the software.  It does not learn day to day."
1buanmc,kxw9t0d,Got a really good inventory deal combined with tax credit and a local rebate.
1buanmc,kxtmkez,Even Tesla doesn‚Äôt consider the FSD value when you trade it in. That says a lot.
1buanmc,kxvgpx7,Yep
1blf96v,kw4w2ys,Known issue. To be fixed in an upcoming update.
1blf96v,kw54vz1,"Yes, drives very slow on this update. Toggle on Automatic Set Speed Offset in the bottom of the picture. Helps a Little, but you can‚Äôt control the speed with the wheel, only the accelerator. 
New update coming soon to fix this. 
Also, I had auto park and lost that feature. 

Overall it drives much smoother, just not up to speed yet."
1blf96v,l1afwgo,"Same problem here. There won‚Äôt be a car writhin a quarter mile and it‚Äôll still drive 6 under what I have it set to.

Edit: 2023 Model 3 SR"
1blf96v,kw89zpe,"Don't have FSD, but even the regular autopilot often farts out completely and thinks it should go 40 when 70 is allowed. Imagine the surprise to the drivers behind when my MY decides to suddenly decrease speed. By now I have stopped to trust it and am ready to maintain speed whenever the software bugs out."
1blf96v,kxirfjx,Unusable when forcing you to drive slow. Dangerous and impractical. I can only use autosteer and will cancel membership until fixed.
1blf96v,kw585uj,Ok so it will take some time. It took about 3 days for me to ‚Äúcalibrate‚Äù. Just a theory based on my own experience. I had the same issue at first with 12. All good now and it‚Äôs freaking amazing. So many issues on my previous routes been rectified.
1blf96v,lbu8fto,"Do you happen to have any info on the known issue to verify? Not trying to call you out, I just installed the 2024.20.7 update tonight and don't want to re-subscribe until this is fixed. Not sure if FSD or other software issue, but assuming FSD."
1blf96v,kw57qs9,Right. Spending too much time pressing accelerator to just maintain the speed limit. Hopefully fixed soon.
1blf96v,kwb7zlb,Just got my 12.3 last night. First driving today was too slow. Hope you are right that it will fix it for me after the few days of driving
1blf96v,kw58nr7,Felt like it would be right on chill setting but assertive should drive at the max speed set based on the offset or manual scroll to set max. Wait and see I guess.
1blf96v,kw59g5g,My recommendation is don‚Äôt set any offset or other settings. Keep things as it is or where applicable ‚Äúauto‚Äù. Drive it for a few days. I promise you it will fix many issues experienced the first few days. It did the same thing to me. At first It had me wishing I could downgrade to my previous version. But now it‚Äôs gotten pretty damn unbelievable. Even the nag has decreased substantially in comparison to the first day.
1blf96v,kxirj0t,Can you explain this better. I'm dying here car is slow slow and not going max speed I set
1biwsig,kvqfz8m,Got mine this week too. Awesome
1biwsig,kvngv02,[deleted]
1biwsig,kvveuih,How do you like it? Streets seems to be a whole lot better‚Ä¶ it is more sure in stop signs and intersections m. It‚Äôs more assertive and no more stoping well before the stop sign and it just stops and take off quicker from stop signs/intersections.
1biwsig,kvo1nbn,"Just turn off FSD in settings?

We got thr 12.3 update today as well, 2022 MYP. Maybe they hit the really big red button?"
1biwsig,kvvgj0t,Have used somewhat in normal traffic. No issues so far. Is definitely assertive but that is ok given how assertive all the normal drivers are.

qg65dl,hi4fury,"I have a relatively uneventful work commute on a 2-lane highway in semi-rural North Carolina, and I've enjoyed it so far.

My main issues are how much it hugs the yellow line (not very safe or comfortable on a 2-lane road where there are frequent semi trucks), and for some reason it brakes almost every time an oncoming car approaches, even when they're fully in their lane and off toward the shoulder."
qg65dl,hi54pg0,I'm really glad that I'm not the only one feeling this way. I posted this hoping I wasn't going to get flamed lol. I really hope we all get to see this thing mature enough to finally impress us and earn our money's worth.
qg65dl,hi4kw09,The funny thing is this is how the ‚Äúsafest drivers‚Äù are reacting - I wonder if it was flipped where the ‚Äúunsafest drivers‚Äù were prioritized they‚Äôd be like woah this thing drives amazingly haha
qg65dl,hi5fyoj,The FSD beta would ironically have the worst safety score.
qg65dl,hi49efk,"I'm definitely not impressed yet, but I'm still becoming comfortable with the feature.  It's not nearly as good as I was expecting based on YouTube videos."
qg65dl,hi4mse0,I don't understand why it uses the brakes so much and never uses regen. It needs to learn how to coast.
qg65dl,hi4bk1q,[deleted]
qg65dl,hi4hxxi,"Agree with everything you said. In addition to the center of the road neighborhood driving it goes too fast and accelerates too fast. I‚Äôve tried all 3 settings and it turns and accelerates way too fast a lot. We have a lot of 45-50mph roads with 90 degree turns onto a 25mph road. It usually thinks hey it‚Äôs 100 yards away I better speed up and then at the last second take the turn at 40. It‚Äôs just way too aggressive when it needs to chill and way to chill when it needs to be aggressive. Blinking yellows freak it out too.

Also has some weird turn behavior where it doesn‚Äôt use the turn signal all the time for me."
qg65dl,hi5k497,"For anybody who has been watchin the FSD beta videos for the last year, this experience, sadly, is not very surprising. What is surprising was their willingness to release this to a larger audience in its current stage. The dramatic exponential improvements with AP / FSD we have been getting promised for years now just haven't panned out. Not that there haven't been improvements, there certainly has. Just not at the rate we were all expecting. It is often a constant dance of 2 steps forward & 1 step back. I'm sure any day now though!

Tesla - how about focusing on getting ***EXISTING*** features to work correctly instead of constantly hyping a feature that is years away from actually being useful? **Smart summon** is useless if there is a car next to you due to the fact that car cant even back STRAIGHT out of a parking spot without getting 80% out and then turning the wheel sharply, attempting to collide with the car next to it *every* time. How complicated is it to just have the car back ALL THE WAY OUT of the space before turning the wheel? No cars next to you? OK, I'll give it a shot (what a shock, still cant back all the way out correctly)... Watching it creep along, often driving through empty parking spots and getting dangerously close to other cars and curbs... its just not good and becomes an added stress, not a convenience. It was an amusing party trick when it was released nearly 3 years ago, but its beyond pathetic they haven't improved the feature in any way since then."
qg65dl,hi4l6n1,This was the most fun $400 I ever spent (2 months of FSD subscription). The safety score thing was like a video game (how often do adults get rated like that in real life?) and I got a high score so I got a real life reward of the beta. Now the next quest is staying alive as my car tries to kill me. Every time I violently disengage I think to myself ‚Äúnot today car‚Äù and award myself points. I‚Äôm not keeping FSD another month tho.
qg65dl,hi4kfad,"No, I find it unusable when other cars are around. If cops are behind you I believe it will definitely get you pulled over as it drives like a drunk 15 year old."
qg65dl,hi4h451,"Similarly not impressed. I don't know why the car can make intelligent lane changes, roundabouts, four way stops, etc., but doesn't understand basic lane centering. I don't want to be an inch from oncoming traffic if there's a nice unoccupied bike lane next to me. You'll let me roll stop signs, let me move us over 2"" to the right so I can relax.

Same goes for stopped traffic. I want a smooth deceleration that gives me confidence that you see the stopped car ahead. Not an ""Oh shit, better slam on the brakes"" reaction. In fact, don't even touch the brake pedal! Use regenerative braking like I would you dummy!"
qg65dl,hi4chkm,"Reading this, calling it ""beta"" seems wrong. Beta means feature complete, but still buggy. Looks more like a development release and lots of features are non existing or only exist as draft."
qg65dl,hi4ap7s,"Ha I've had the EXACT same issues/experience. The best part is it defaults to 25MPH in the neighborhood which yes, I understand in normal sub-divisions/neighborhoods that is usually the default but HOT damn it jumps up to speed!   


I got on my daily on-ramp this morning with FSD taking the wheel... holy warp speed 7! 

Auto High beams are complete crap as well. On, off, offfff ON and blind them all!

Still interesting and I'll keep using it to help the system but it's way funky in real like compared to the youtube videos I see of Chuck Cook and Dirty Tesla driving, they seem pretty cool/calm and the wheel doesn't ever seem to be jerking left/right at a high rate but maybe I just haven't see it in their videos."
qg65dl,hi4edbi,"This is the problem with influencers being invited into beta. They have a vested interest in hype and manipulating their audience, especially those that are invested in Tesla as shareholders, but also simply because Tesla hype makes you money as a content creator.

The reality is that this is beta software and you are a tester. Ostensibly everyone on beta is a tester, it's just that some take that more critically to heart than others. Tesla and Elon have done nothing to correctly set expectations beyond a singular email you get when you are pushed the beta, but that's not enough to undo the years of conditioning that Elon and other hypesters have created."
qg65dl,hi5aecl,"Oh yeah, it‚Äôs super neat to play with an _early_ glimpse of the future. But man is it as self-assured as it is unskilled in doing graceful (and safe) maneuvers."
qg65dl,hi4b37y,"In my location in New England. I was extremely impressed. Drove to a doctors appointment with only one intervention. Then returned with no interventions. 
To be fair It‚Äôs not like a city city. It‚Äôs a small town, but handled it with pure ease."
qg65dl,hi5lt2m,"My experience so far... Mostly with assertive, but I've done a bit in the other modes too.

Coming out of neighborhood, same problems as you. Needs to stay to the edge rather than the center all the time. It does a decent job going around parked cars, but imo, it needs to move further around them (dont want to be 1ft from a parked car if someone is in it and might open their door).

When turning onto the main road, it not only is still centered on the 2 way neighborhood street (no dividing line), but it creeps out past the stop sign and keeps going even further towards the left when preparing for a left turn. This means that a car turning off the main road onto my side street would not have any room to turn in.

The turn itself is definitely extremely cautious and also very slow. Same at red lights when there is no one in front of me. It takes too long to get moving.

Driving down the road in traffic mostly does a decent job. My biggest gripes are probably map data for lane usage. It's common for the car to turn into a lane that's ending imminently to go around someone (even on non assertive settings). 

Phantom breaking on 2 lane roads seems very common, even when there are no other cars around me (straight road, no obstructions).

NoA still sucks, it's really bad about getting into the lane in time when there is traffic, and frequently misses exits for me.

When driving between stop lights where it can get up to full speed between the lights with some minimal traffic at the lights, the car brakes *hard* when almost on top of the other cars. It does not do a good job detecting the stopped cars ahead and slowly using only regen braking. The car ends up using it's actual brakes and makes for a fairly unpleasant ride (and somewhat scary). These are big well marked straight roads where people travel about 50mph between the stoplights.

Several times I've seen it signal to change lanes and then change it's mind. The people behind me probably think I'm nuts.

Driving next to an oversize load required a manual intervention when the car couldn't get by it without setting off fcws and slamming brakes.

Overall, happy to test it, look forward to seeing it improve over time, but it's definitely got some things to work on."
qg65dl,hi69kd1,"I also had the impression things were much further along. I fully understand the slow progress having a long and varied background in this type of software and control system engineering. 

I can only really make one generic comment that testing has been clearly inadequate. I assume the wider rollout is an attempt to address this, but if that‚Äôs the case I disagree with Tesla‚Äôs approach to resolve the issue. They need way better unit tests, system tests, and internal QA. Some of the bugs are just unacceptable even for beta. 

I see so many issues, bugs, illegal maneuvers, and safety issues I‚Äôm working on a template for bug reporting and an app to collect supplemental voice memos with each snapshot that will transcribe to text because there are so many each drive I can‚Äôt remember them all to add detail. 

I would suggest to Tesla they modify their app to automatically take voice memos when a report is made via the car main screen by using the Bluetooth link from the car to the phone to initiate a voice memo that transcribes to text and associates a uuid with it from the snapshot taken so engineering can correlate them."
qg65dl,hi4jn14,"I think the key is to know what it does well and what it does bad. If there is something it doesn't do well, just take over and do it yourself.

From my limited usage of the beta, it seems like it handle straight roads better than before, and I am glad to not need to confirm every time i go through a green light.

It also seems to do pretty well on right turns, but I wish it would signal when getting into a turn lane, instead of just signaling before the turn.

I don't think it does left turns very well, so I won't let it do it for a while.

My community has a two lanes at the entrance for a gate and it has no idea what to do, so i need to take over.

There is small speed bump in my community and it doesn't seem to slow down for it."
qg65dl,hi5a1k4,"I agree, I‚Äôm on my second year of FSD. There have been impressive strides over the last two years but I almost never use FSD anymore, it‚Äôs rare I can even go a mile without intervening. 

The only time I feel FSD is good is when I‚Äôm in traffic on the highway or going straight In rural road. If there‚Äôs any turns or I have to go through my neighborhood, forget it. Even the Summon feature is only successful 20% of the times. I feel we are at least 5 more years until FSD is realistic. My lease ends in 8 months, I‚Äôm strongly considering not even purchasing the FSD for the new Plaid X (I have 2019 X now)

Edit: added a good feature"
qg65dl,hi5n1o6,I honestly can‚Äôt believe Tesla is getting away with putting this on the roads in a semi-wide release.
qg65dl,hi4a8vq,"No,  mine decides to swerve into cars so I don't even use it. It appears to be all fine if there's no cars, but as soon as it sees a car drive by it decides to swerve and hit them. I'm honestly dumbfounded how the YouTube videos go, mine are totally on the opposite scale."
qg65dl,hi6w1m5,"This isn‚Äôt going to be popular, but with current hardware it will never be safe. You just can‚Äôt visually see everything you need to. Simple as that. You would need a dome on top of your car with 360 degree view. I think it could work, as long as it‚Äôs not raining, snowing or foggy. I would be happy if they would just fix the phantom breaking on auto pilot."
qg65dl,hi4i176,"Mine works fairly well. It‚Äôs not perfect. It‚Äôs definitely slow to go and stops far back at stop signs, and there are a few unique scenarios where it‚Äôs made the wrong call (getting in a turning lane when I want to go straight etc)‚Ä¶ that being said, this is bleeding edge stuff. No competitor that I know of is even close. It‚Äôll get better, but for now I‚Äôm impressed that I can drive to work and back and do as little as stay attentive and help it accelerate faster at an occasional light. If there‚Äôs a tough scenario who cares if I have to take over for 5 seconds while it learns. Just a year ago I was driving 100% of the time, it‚Äôs like a 99.99% reduction.

At this point, I feel like I‚Äôm driving with a student driver, I‚Äôve got to watch and have to help a bit, but 99% of the time, I‚Äôm not driving, which is awesome!"
qg65dl,hi5qv6w,"Most of what it struggles with makes sense to me. Unprotected left turns are complicated.

What I don‚Äôt understand is the breaking. If I drove like fsd literally every stop sign and red light would be a ‚Äúhard breaking‚Äù event. If the car in front stops a foot earlier than the path planner expected it slams on the break. Like.. wtf does it think is going to happen? It still has 10+ft of space, just set the planned buffer follow distance to 2sec and the hard breaking activation to 1sec. Anything in between should use the perfectly smooth ‚Äúfoot off the accelerator‚Äù breaking to come to a complete stop. It‚Äôs perfect already. As is it‚Äôs making me nauseous. Plus a 1 or 2sec buffer at 2mph is wayyy closer than it‚Äôs currently stopping at."
qg65dl,hi61fa0,"This is why I am shocked how many people are falling over themselves to get in the beta. Sure it will be fun to play with from time to time, but more stressful than just driving yourself. Don't get me wrong, I love AP on the highways, but there is so much less that can go wrong so it is much easier to monitor."
qg65dl,hi66fye,"So how easy is it to get out of FSD beta once you're in? I am at 99 and tempted to try it when I get the invite, but can tell already I don't want to keep it. I value my radar based AP too much..."
qg65dl,hi7k8z9,It‚Äôs never going to work vision only. There are way to many factors the current camera set will never account for with the current compute set. Don‚Äôt get me wrong the FSD computer is impressive probably on par with a 3080 but your car will always make shitty left hand turns and maybe brake for the moon as a yellow light.
qg65dl,hi80524,Mine was so sketchy today. It was literally driving on the inside lane lines and after 2 honks from other cars I jist turned it off.
qg65dl,hi4m91o,"Very similar experience here. Driving in the middle of the road in the neighborhood, had to cancel. Insanely slow taking a turn at the stop sign - slowly edge forward, stop, edge more, stop, edge more, stop. Slowly start taking the turn then stop for an instant then go. This isn‚Äôt usable without passing off everyone around you. 

What gets me is this isn‚Äôt something that needs ‚Äúmore data/more miles‚Äù to solve. 

If you truly want to be an unpaid tester - this is neat. If you were hoping for something that ‚Äúsometimes gets you there with no interruptions‚Äù for the purpose of stress reduction - that‚Äôs many years away. 

Robotaxis? When the car can drive like a human with nobody at the steering wheel! Mmmmm... yeah that‚Äôs not happening any time soon."
qg65dl,hi4jizs,"Remember, this is beta software

I got on to FSD Beta 10.2 on the 15th.

In my time of using it, and then FSD Beta 10.3.1 there is noticeable improvement.

The important thing to do is to repeatedly send in the clips of problem areas as you drive.

I had an issue on this road here: https://imgur.com/OkWh3sr for example where on 10.2 it followed the path of the yellow arrow, where when traveling north on the road it would cross in to oncoming traffic.  On 10.3.1 it doesn't do that, now it stays on the right side of the road.

Now I will give this road a bit of a pass because it is a new community, so the road isn't officially mapped, and odds are I'm the first person who gave them mapping data about it.

There's also the gate to my community.  Previously the car would attempt to ram it on 10.2, and now on 10.3.1 it stops for the gate, and waits for it to open.

There are marked improvements from 10.2 to 10.3.1, however, a fair chunk of the issues relate to navigation data.

I did a YouTube drive through of Disney World while on 10.2 where I showed a variety of the issues that folks some of the issues they can expect and such: https://youtu.be/Z3LWl70ILOM once you ignore the rambling and just skip to the bookmarked spots, folks can understand what's up.

As a whole the only way to really improve the system is to drive it, experience the stupid shit it does, and push the button to send the clip in.  *Each time* it does stupid shit.

Over time we'll see steady improvements.

The other issues we're fighting appears to be stale navigation data.  Not sure how to fix that one since they don't appear to pull from OpenStreetMaps, it's clear a lot of the current stuff is from OSM, again, the Disney World drive through, and the associated reddit post clarifies a lot of that.

Now that it's all imported in to their MapBox instance their maps just aren't being updated without people driving around.

Just keep hitting the button, it does get better, slowly but surely, but it is a beta, and it is going to perform like shit here and there."
qg65dl,hi4cnxt,"It is the beta so you should temper expectations.

However I see the exact same issues as you.  Too far in the middle and too slow approaching stop signs.

Keep using FSD though and keep turning the wheel out of FSD.  Every wheel turn or brake that takes you out gets sent to Tesla.  I believe any throttle override is also sent back.

Also use the email and write them‚Ä¶we need to provide feedback‚Ä¶.that‚Äôs why we are beta testers.

Also curious what region are you in?"
qg65dl,hi820jt,"And you're surprised? I hope not. Musk has a reputation for releasing buggy, barley working, beta software."
qg65dl,hi444o3,[deleted]
qg65dl,hi4t8pc,"So I'm still trying to figure out what ""profile"" works the best, and I suspect depending on the state/driving conditions, they will be different. Personally, I find the ""assertive"" mode to be the best overall, as it doesn't constantly keep trying to get into the right lane on roads around here, which is usually full of parked cars.

Still, yeah, it doesn't speed up through unprotected left turns fast enough. It definitely has some moments of phantom braking I can't figure out, like a spooked horse. There's a few turns around here it STILL doesn't slow down fast enough into, and it veers a bit into the other lane, which is what I was hoping it would fix over autopilot.

I wish it would not do a rolling stop through stop signs. Just wait a fucking second, bro. It's legally just needing to stop there for 3-5 seconds, so chill out. 

I still am glad its here, even to replace autopilot, which I can definitely say was a way more shaky experience overall on roads around here."
qg65dl,hi4w41b,"Here is the deal, the whole safety score made us drive extra smooth for several miles‚Ä¶ I was coasting way before stop signs, making turns very slowly and just really being extra safe. you get FSDBeta and it‚Äôs the total opposite and really shocks you at first. The lane choice, late braking, etc‚Ä¶ I wonder what does it take to tune this better."
qg65dl,hi4zakv,"Good feedback! I have pretty much the same.
FSD doesn‚Äôt work well in neighborhoods with tight streets and is often too slow to cross a stop or start again at a green light.

With well defined roads, no cars behind it‚Äôs fairly usable.

To me these issues are more about fine tuning (assertiveness, human like driving behaviors) than actual vision processing issues. E.g I would assume FSD works quite well in suburbs but not so much downtown.

1 big missing piece I found is that I‚Äôm not sure it reads the ‚Äúno turn on red signs‚Äù."
qg65dl,hi5g4dt,I find that it takes exit ramps way too quickly.  I don't use it much.
qg65dl,hi5p9m5,"Mine crapped the bed on the highway. It kept giving me FCW and shutting down AP.  Then the system froze for 30seconds and came back on with a flurry of warnings, telling me no more fsd this drive. Ok."
qg65dl,hi6fyru,"A few notes. In neighborhoods, if you let it go, as soon as it sees a car it will get over to the side of the road to allow safe passage for both cars but it is annoying driving in the middle. 

Also, if it‚Äôs going slow to turn, just give it a little throttle to let it know it‚Äôs ok and it will go. No need to wait. 

As for turns, anytime it‚Äôs a two lane turn, with two rows of cars turning it has some issues with lane detection and will struggle here. Usually best to not even let it try in my testing."
qg65dl,hi777kv,Please make sure everyone is hitting the capture icon whenever anything incorrectly occurs. This will help send many helpful clips and instances to Tesla for correction.
qg65dl,hi78wsl,üòÇsounds terribleüòÇ
qg65dl,hibjwh8,"Same scenario.  Neighborhood without lane markings it drives near center of both.. 
there are a lot of great things but also some very scary moments that need you ready to take over for sure.   
Came to stop sign and it was unprotected left turn,  it creeps forward and left onto the oncoming lane before it decides to go.  Very odd because if someone was trying to turn right onto my road I‚Äôm in the way.

Came to a stop light and in left turn lane and it creeps forward and decides it‚Äôs gonna run the red light.  

One thing I‚Äôve not seen @chazman or anyone else mention is the braking randomly while it‚Äôs driving straight and no Or few cars around.  It‚Äôs like a brake check almost.  35mph to 30 then back up to 35.    It also misses speed limit signs sometimes and doesn‚Äôt slow down or slows down 1/8 mile after the sign.

Been very impressed with right turns from clean street to clean street (ie. well marked roads)"
qg65dl,hja1ce1,"I got the beta 3 days ago. I was super eager to get it - had my 2020 M3P for almost 2 years.

After a few trips, I'm conflicted on the current performance. It hasn't done anything ""dumb"" just yet, but **it's too aggressive!**

I have set to Chill mode, but it's just too jerky on acceleration and braking. Not nearly as smooth as I would normally drive. Because the acceleration and braking isn't smooth, it erodes my confidence in its ability.

&#x200B;

Anyone else?"
qg65dl,hkfeh8r,FSD is so bad I‚Äôm ready to opt out
qg65dl,hi4vixd,"The thing that has been the biggest disappointment to me is its inability to chose the correct lane at intersections. It seems incapable of seeing the painted turn signs in the road. I had thought this would have been a fairly straight forward problem. Overall I am still excited to be part of the beta program, but yeah agree w/ others that youtubers had previously given us a pretty biased picture of what it was like."
qg65dl,hi52ys8,"I changed the FSD profile to chill and it is driving much more reasonably now. I don't mind it being careful around unprotected intersections, let it take its time and make sure it's safe. 

Really need to improve braking and use regenerative braking to coast to a stop gently. Really need to take turns more smoothly, but it's mostly capable of going from my driveway to destinations with minimal interventions. 

Some other weird things is is the navigation shows the destination in the main road, it'll attempt to stop in the middle of the main road. It has a hard time with unmarked detours but honestly impressed with how well it handled an unmarked dirt road today. 

It's not perfect, it's obviously missing so much, it's not a beta of the full FSD project, it's a beta of currently working features. It's late, it's not close to done, and it's amazing as shit when it drives the entire trip with no interventions!"
qg65dl,hi4ik1m,"It is beta, and it sucks. I am telling you the truth. Just ignore the idiots saying we are lucky blalala.    It is creepy af and we are paying for it. If you don‚Äôt feel comfortable on certain road. Press the button and report it, and don‚Äôt try it again until next version.
By the way, it does ghost brake sometimes. Do not use it if there is an fktard driving close behind you"
qg65dl,hi4qz38,"Mine‚Äôs doing pretty well. It makes some mistakes here and there, I report them, and hopefully it gets better every update. Overall I‚Äôm impressed."
qg65dl,hi4dcuv,"I you watched recent Beta videos, that how FSD is at the moment. What you described is what most other testers experience.
But it's getting better every week. Six months ago was considerably worse."
qg65dl,hi4jow2,I am disappointed enough that I may ask to be removed from the beta before road trips during thanksgiving and Xmas
qg65dl,hi4atgx,"It‚Äôs a beta version. It‚Äôs not supposed to be polished and it isn‚Äôt polished. It‚Äôs very rough on the edges. I think it‚Äôs amazing how far Tesla has come with it but there‚Äôs a long way to go. It is not to be trusted in the same way that autopilot can be trusted on the freeway. (And, even then, you still need to pay attention when AP is enabled)."
qg65dl,hi4jz3q,This is a yes or no answer type of question in which the only real answer is no and will result in many different variations of the exact same response that all could just be summarized by 3 words: it‚Äôs a beta.
qg65dl,hi5w1by,"A relatively normal report actually, comparing with what can be found on YT. One thing about driving in the middle of the road in your neighborhood: if it sees an oncoming car it‚Äôll move over to the right for it, so feel free to try it next time and see how that feels"
qg65dl,hi6wqen,"I'm quite impressed actually. And very hopeful.

I think the hardest part is the world mapping. Once the world is mapped correctly, navigating it isn't as hard.

Yes, it needs to stay further to the right on residential roads. Yes, it has issues with unprotected lefts ( just as I do ). Yes, it makes mistakes.

But I see the road to the finish line.

They could make changes that would make it more useful for the drivers, but that would make it less useful as a beta product.

That said, I think they're going to need two more cameras for it to work. Basically where the headlights are, facing outward."
qg65dl,hi7b9g1,"My exp with 10.3 has been increasingly positive in the past two days. I think it's partly due to the rainy weather earlier in Bay area which reduced its ability to recognize lanes (today roads are all dry). But there were a couple turns at same location with similar visibility/traffic condition that it did much better today.

Here's my thoughts on its performance today:

Good: auto lane changes on city street especially during somewhat busy hour were really impressive, definitely better than my wife driving!  Also stop signs are handled well although more on conservative side.

Bad: sharp, small turns that it can't see well until last moment, by the time it sees the turn it's too late/fast to make it. I always think it should use the map/gps to preload the location/curvature info and prepare for the next turn even before seeing the turn, which is how we human drive. But it doesn't.  It's too ""pure vision"".

Works but not well: it's sometimes too hesitant to make a decision, e.g., coming from a small lane onto a main road, or go through a roundabout. Overall it sometimes drive like old grandma, arguably not unsafe but just slow"
qg65dl,hi7btbc,It‚Äôs overly cautious. Too much phantom braking right now. Supposedly that will improve.
qg65dl,hi4cm1a,"You are in a very select group of about 5000 people given early access, and have jumped through some hoops to get here. Just enjoy what it has and watch it improve over time."
qg65dl,hi4g4uf,You don‚Äôt have to disable it because it drives in the center. It will move over when it sees another car.
qg65dl,hi4t4j6,Start off on an easy drive to get a feel for how the cat reacts and adjust to the new visualizations. Gradually take it out on more dynamic or congested routes. Don't engage it if you're not comfortable with the surroundings.  This is beta. And only a few thousand people have access currently. It will take time but it's better than it was a year ago!
qg65dl,hi5qrgm,Basic autopilot performs relatively poorly. Why does anyone think FSD will work well ü§®
qg65dl,hi5sl57,"I tried submitting a text post but my submissions are not showing up for some reason and I am not sure why, so I figured I would ask here...

I am new to the beta. I would like to do my part by providing Tesla with feedback regarding FSD performance. The thing I am unsure of is how picky I should be when it comes to missteps in the FSD system, and what kind of things I should be providing active (email/pressing that video button) feedback for. I know there are a LOT more beta testers now, and I'm sure there is a wide range of people, some may press that video button on every little hiccup and email FSDBeta every day, and some may not engage at all.

I'm looking for opinions on people who are familiar with processing this kind of feedback from beta testers, people who've been in the beta program long term, tesla recommendations, and general thoughts. In the email saying I would be getting FSD, it just stated methods to provide feedback, but there was no guidance on how often or how sensitive that feedback should be. I don't want to flood them with minor things if that's not what they are looking for, but on the flip side, if they want to be sent clips of every FSD action that needs improvement, I can certainly start doing that.

I have had the beta since 10.3 and I have hit the video send button maybe 3 times and it was when my car drove onto the curb on the inside of a roundabout, once when it was taking a corner and actually drove off the road (there was no white line) and I can't remember the third. I have never emailed them about any issues yet.

What are your thoughts and habits on this process? Is it better to provide more information, even if it's very minor, or should the feedback be saved for more major things as to not overwhelm the beta team?

Appreciate any feedback. Thank you."
qg65dl,hi5z2n2,"My one month with autopilot made me realize the car drives like a tentative jerk. It would act like a student driver merging onto the freeway one moment, and the next it would hug the adjacent lane while exiting until the very last second...as if it didn't want to let cars behind me get on with their 70mph lives.

I'm looking forward to the days I can rely on my car to drive me, but sheesh, it's gonna be awhile. Thanks to Tesla though for bringing up estimated timelines by decades."
qg65dl,hi6gdrm,"I've been testing since the first batch of the ""open"" beta (10.2) and it takes some getting used to for sure.  You eventually learn to know when it's going to mess up.  

One repeatable issue I've found is turning right onto a road and it thinks the bike lane is a lane.  In looking at map data, the bike lane isn't marked, so again, the curse of stale map data rears its ugly head.

The performance of NOA vs. FSD is really noticeable.  Was driving down a highway today.  Interesting scenario.  At a stop light, the road ""converts"" to a freeway.  Same road, same lanes everything, after the stop light it's a freeway, and NOA kicked in.

Results:

* acceleration on NOA was very slow, it was set to 60mph, I had to tap the go pedal to get it up to speed as people were riding my tail.
* when I was coming up to the same stop light on my return (here it was on NOA and about to switch to FSD after the light), there were a number of cars and NOA just kept going full speed until the last bit and then slammed on the brakes.
* after going back onto FSD after the light, braking was much better, as was lane keeping.

Can't wait for single stack.

Edit: [This is the intersection](https://imgur.com/a/arc4GYG) I'm talking about.  The classifications are from OpenStreetMaps.org, and note how it changes exactly at the light.  We really need updated map data."

Sometimes it is an anticipation thing, where it doesn't identify which lanes go straight through the next light ahead of time and gets stuck in turn lanes.  But sometimes it will actually jump in the turn lane at a light where it is supposed to go straight for no reason at all.  
  
The other thing it does is panic and stall out in my neighborhood when it can't see around tall parked cars.  Though to be fair as a human driver in these situations you really do just have to take the turn blind and assume anyone coming through the canyon of SUVs is going slow enough to stop in time.  
  
But then it will do brilliant things like scoot through tight gaps while turning, and pull over to let other cars by (on the same narrow street)."
qg65dl,hi4yq8w,Have had 99 score since Friday no beta at all yet
qg65dl,hi5iv63,"I'm sorry for your negative experiences but it's important to note this isn't the same for everybody. Some people have reported never needing to intervene at all. This kind of post is being linked to by TSLAQ types, it's best to communicate your concerns directly to Tesla rather than the public."
qg65dl,hi994et,"It's very geographical.  It works extremely well where my primary house is, and works good at my second home.  This is the whole purpose of expanding the testing fleet to gather data and machine learning for a wider range of locations.

I don't find the negative posts very productive and kind of misses the point of the beta that we have chosen to participate in. 

Overall I've been extremely impressed with the beta, especially in my main area. My 13 mile commute to work I have one disengagement that I've submitted.  Lots of turns, intersections, etc.  That area has very well marked and designed roads, though.

So instead of the negativity, maybe continue to test and submit data so we can make it better for a wider range of areas."
qg65dl,hi4w0ml,"It's really bad in several ways currently, and I think the reason for that is primarily that they made several errors along the way. The cameras and the hw had to be replaced, and then they have realized their rather poor radar was holding them back. All of this caused problems and delays and ultimately rewrites. And I think the latest rewrite after removing the radar made them appear much less sophisticated.

We don't yet know how well it will behave after the single stack, but I'm actually pretty optimistic it will improve much faster here on out."
qg65dl,hi58mqr,It‚Äôs a beta. You aren‚Äôt really supposed to be impressed. It still has a lot of work to be done.
qg65dl,hi4osxf,Thanks everyone for teaching the AI. In a few months I think it will be pretty good (not L5).
qg65dl,hi4xmjr,I will keep taking snapshots and hope it will help to improve faster
qg65dl,hi52l47,Just try the other two modes apart from Assertive on your daily commute. I have been seeing progress in the last two builds. They are improving for sure and such fun experience if we pay good attention to the surroundings.
qg65dl,hi52ycs,"its whats expected at this point in time. /u/greentheonly 's tweet is worth a thousand words (although it was during 10.2):

https://twitter.com/greentheonly/status/1448066773589401606"
qg65dl,hi54rtu,"On a basic level, for those ""residential"" streets, why is there not the basic function to take the width of the road, divide by two, take the division and find center line with right and left buffer?

There seems to be either missing stacks for basic functions or human corrected stacks that are not universal.

I keep a log and send emails at the end of day with a narrative, links to Google street view of the locations, and make sure to push the camera button to send. Staying vigilant in reporting will hopefully make this better....if anyone is actually fielding these emails. It would be nice to get feedback or even a ticket tracking type of system so we know if our efforts are actually worthwhile."
qg65dl,hi561x3,"Location: Kansas City.

Had a bad experience so far. Once tried to change two lanes instantly almost hitting an SUV in the lane. Tried to go onto the oncoming lane once."
qg65dl,hi582re,"The thing that surprised me the most is inaccurate close-range distance judgments while traversing the field of vision across various cameras.   I often am seeing a noticeable jump in lane line distance on drivers side of the vehicle from just in front of my car, to just next to my car (while driving).

Also, I allowed FSD Beta to pull out of a VERY generously spaced parallel parking spot, and it was going to aggressively smash into the bumper of the car parked in front of me.  At a stop (before pulling forward) the car parked in front of me was more than 5 ft away.  These 2 experiences were the most surprising but not as dramatic as most of the others."
qg65dl,hi5d0yg,"I drive in the middle of the street in neighborhoods too. It's safer in case kids or something runs into the street, you have better clearance. Obviously I pull to the side for oncoming traffic"
qg65dl,hi5dm9g,"The neighborhood road thing is a common complaint, I think it used to keep to the side on older builds but for whatever reason it got changed. I think it's potentially a safety thing, not confident enough about hitting parked cars on the sides of the road. 

That said, some people do drive like this, annoying when people do, but it's not that uncommon to see cars on the road like this."
qg65dl,hi5gmqd,"I think the issue is that we're used to seeing videos (which doesn't really capture the experience) and hearing commentary from testers who have already been testing FSD for a while.

10.3 I'm certain is much improved when compared to earlier versions. But to me, as a person who has never experienced FSD before, the only baseline is my own driving (or other humans).

From that reference point, FSD is like putting your 13-year old son/daughter in the driver seat after a brief verbal explanation of what the vehicle controls do and what the road lines/signs mean and saying ""OK NOW YOU DRIVE.""

As technology, it's freaking impressive. But as a driver, it's clumsy and scary. With more data coming it, it should hopefully get refined more quickly."
qg65dl,hi5nk19,I've watched it get better and better since it came out around this time last year. I think soon enough it will handle your work commute flawlessly. If they complete Dojo halfway through 2022 and use it to train FSD I think by this time next year there will be a huge improvement over today's version.
qg65dl,hi5pkjq,"It gets better! I only have experience from 10.2 to 10.3 but already I've seen improvements on my commute lol

Some things didn't improve, but those that did definitely left me shocked (right turns and left turns especially)"
qg65dl,hi5qa6c,Thanks for sharing.
qg65dl,hi5rayo,First world problems as I wait for the beta with 100/100+ miles.
qg65dl,hi5sl2v,My passenger side camera isn‚Äôt working at all even after reboot and recalibration

qg65dl,hi6c54i,"The way it handles neighborhoods is seriously questionable.  They really need to open up an option to force it to drive x mph under the speed limit in residential areas.  I get the speed limit is 25, but if you are going over 15 you are wrong."
qg65dl,hi6kjcg,"I‚Äôm impressed mainly because my car feels close to how another self driving service felt in 2017-2018.

Can‚Äôt say much about the other service, but the turns, braking, and confidence all feels fairly similar to the other service.

Makes me excited about what comes next as Tesla improves and gets to the point of release.

I live in the Phoenix area so admittedly our roads are much easier to navigate.

Tesla is at a huge disadvantage because they can‚Äôt just simply map an area and avoid all the hard parts.  Tesla also doesn‚Äôt have the luxury of remote operators or a limited service area.  All I‚Äôm all I am impressed, and excited for the future."
qg65dl,hi6p3sp,"Well, I had a low bar going in so I still think it is better than I personal expected. I have to help it along at times, it is not aggressive enough, it stops too soon for stop signs, it isn‚Äôt aggressive enough, it doesn‚Äôt do roundabouts well, and it isn‚Äôt aggressive enough. So‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs still fun and overall better than I thought it would be."
qg65dl,hi6wpsk,I read from others that Chill or Regular are the only viable modes right now.  Assertive is unusable.
qg65dl,hi8c7wy,"At least you can test the Beta. I would Like to have it, but since I'm in Europe, no FSD Beta for me ;("
qg65dl,hib7nl5,Yeah performance isn‚Äôt all that great. I‚Äôve had a lot of random right turns when driving. It looked like I was intentionally aiming to hit a woman. Also my car attempted to pass a car on the right with a lane merging. Made me look like a real dick üòÇ.
qg65dl,hidbkec,"I'll throw in that as a new beta tester, in smallish eastern TN city, FSD takes my route to work and back, getting on and off interstates and divided highways, without much issue. 90% of the turns FSD is able to navigate similar to a human driver."
qg65dl,hifkl52,"I have the same issues plus, it miss some turns sometime for no reason, wait to the last minute to change two lanes to take left turn, cannot figure out railroad if you have two or one car space between the railroad and the traffic light line"
qg65dl,hj360vv,"After one day of using FSD beta my wife banned me from using it. It literally stopped in the middle of the road. It randomly moved toward the curb, and there were many phantom braking. It certainly is dangerous in its current form."
qg65dl,hkc7jsr,"My model y fsd beta is terrible. My daily commute is mainly on 2 lane rural roads. While driving at 65 with no other vehicles around fsd beta will suddenly slow to 45 and then speed back to 65.  Around curves it will slow down to 15. Prior to update. It would slow down to 40 on the same curves. The auto windshield wipers and high beams don't work correctly. I tried turning off fsd beta and everything was worse. Fsd beta off whenever the vehicle sees headlights the vehicle will slow down 10mph. 

You cannot drink coffee, change the radio. Because it will beep at you to keep your eyes on the road. I was trying to send a autopilot snapshot and the system cut off. 

Prior to the update I loved the vehicle.  I'm now looking to get rid of it."
qg65dl,hi4yilr,YES! My thoughts exactly on 2 way roads.  Needs to drive like a human and hug the shoulder.
qg65dl,hi5qhqp,"> My main issues are how much it hugs the yellow line (not very safe or comfortable on a 2-lane road where there are frequent semi trucks), and for some reason it brakes almost every time an oncoming car approaches, even when they're fully in their lane and off toward the shoulder.

Thank you for using there, they're and their in a single sentence correctly.  I'm usually so distracted by how everyone gets it wrong that I was actually distracted by someone getting it right."
qg65dl,hi50wyd,Interesting.  I noticed it moving over a bit when oncoming traffic approaches.
qg65dl,hi5xa8w,"If there is no oncoming traffic, I get closer to the yellow line, especially if there is limited visibility on the sides (trees, etc.). It would give you more chance to avoid a deer if it jumps onto the road.

On a slower suburban road, I also drive closer to the middle in case there is a random kid popping out. Even when driving under the low speedlimit.

Obviously when there is a car approaching, I make room (and may even slow down more depending on the situation)"
qg65dl,hi6uab5,This and auto-brights at night. They consistently deactivate for oncoming traffic a full 3-5 seconds later than I would and it gives me so much anxiety about being an asshole.
qg65dl,hi51q1r,"I hear people say things like ""FSD beta drives better than me!"" and I'm like ""Damnnnn you must really suck at driving."""
qg65dl,hidrty9,"Which, unsurprisingly is the reason they introduced the safety score.  By requiring a 100 or 99, they helped to insure you could be relied upon to be a *hyper* attentive driver.

Doing things like trying to predict what other drivers are going to do so you avoid hard breaking etc.  

You're basically doing the same when on Beta, being hyper attentive to prevent it from doing the ""wrong things at the worst times"" as the release notes say.

It's what we all signed up for..."
qg65dl,hi77fd0,"That's the truth! Its score would be very low. It's slamming the brakes, doing hard turns, waiting until the last moment to slow (hard brake) and jerking the wheel. Thank goodness it's not affecting my score."
qg65dl,hi4c3bl,"I'm definitely impressed. For what it \*can\* do confidently, it's amazing. But it's going to have dumb moments. The more dumb moments you have, the more great training data you're giving Tesla to improve it.

So keep on, and never, ever, ever get comfortable. Not until it's released and not until Tesla says ""you can nap on your way to work, we'll take the blame""."
qg65dl,hi4qyp1,"I think this is best answer. Some of this is just getting comfortable with how it differs from your own driving. 

I find the car brakes too late for my personal taste as approaching an intersection. It‚Äôs not braking harder, it just starts later. It‚Äôs uneasy at first until you get confident that it simply has a different threshold. 

I‚Äôm giving it a pass for the first week and attempting to withhold major judgment though it‚Äôs clear there is a lot of improvement needed."
qg65dl,hi4e30e,You got Musked
qg65dl,hi4jiwl,"IME you have to get used to the system and its limits, in the same way one gets used to autopilot"
qg65dl,hi4wxbw,[deleted]
qg65dl,hi4m03z,"You realize you‚Äôre on the bleeding edge of the newest technology of the future, right?"
qg65dl,hi4uj7y,Autopilot doesn‚Äôt seem to use regen either. How is it still unable to detect the need to stop until the last few seconds
qg65dl,hi4sjjc,"The determination of speed is awful all around. Given that speed in a straight line is quite literally a ballistics problem, it's actually pretty sad that they can't figure out speed from a standstill, speed to coast, speed to slow down, etc. The vision team is killing it under Karpathy, the other teams... not so much."
qg65dl,hi51g5a,"What makes no sense to me is that the Traction Control firmware has a super sophisticated vehicle dynamics simulation that knows exactly how the car is going to perform based on throttle, brakes, steering wheel and detected conditions. 

So the FSD code should be able to run its plan through the dynamics sim and be like ""Will this plan result in 10G of acceleration and spinal trauma from whiplash?"""
qg65dl,hi4ehfr,"Yeah, I'm a bit disappointed too. 75% of the time it's doing well. A few moments were very impressive! 

The other 25% is a mixed bag of too cautious, too slow, way too fast, random inexplicable hard braking, sudden extreme wheel jerks, wrong lane choices, and a handful of purely terrifying moments that scared the shit out of me."
qg65dl,hi5b95y,"Gotta keep hitting the ""clips"" button.  I had an issue where it would try to plough in to my community gate on 10.2, but it's been fixed in 10.3.1."
qg65dl,hi881uo,"Didn‚Äôt last a day on it.  I don‚Äôt know why I was expecting more, but it‚Äôs a huge safety concern. Today my FSD subscription ends (real reason I had it was for the beta). I just let it run out and will stick to basic AP for now. 10.3 shook me real goood."
qg65dl,hi4l82r,"I think Tesla Vision has been enabled only from 10.1. So yes, lots of training is still necessary, but at least the 3D space detection has been solved - which I guess was the hardest part of the problem."
qg65dl,hi862ly,"Sorry to sound a bit negative (I have background in CS and this is bit sad to hear). The Tesla team seems to be working around the clock to fix all of the features of the system. The problem is just that, get it to work very good. It doesn't work as smooth as it should because of the current ""settings"" being not general enough. In some scenarios it works buttery smooth, but in most it's very janky. Imagine for a second that you want to code something (by hand) that can handle any turn, in like 90% of the roads it encounters. Impossible.

They are trying to find a global solution (they're taking many different parameters in to account and they need to do a lot of tweaking of each ""node"").

That's the exact thing they're working on, read the release notes. You don't notice it, but for each update it gets closer and closer to a global solution that can handle everyday tasks. One cannot just say, alright, let me fix turning and make it work everywhere. That's not how it works. One solution that may work perfectly for some roads, might lead to some very dangerous behaviour on other roads when turning. That's why we see some back and forths, they get it to work better in an area, but then it leads to something becoming slightly worse. They need to fine tune it over and over again, and make sure it works as a global solution.

If you don't want to take my words as the truth, I do recommend anyone to try and develop their own basic neural network. Tools and docs are on the internet, try it."
qg65dl,hi5x29h,Existing FSD code navigates parking lots quite confidently. When they pull the trigger on the single stack they'll ditch old summon code altogether instead of making fixes.
qg65dl,hi4z3wd,Proof that reframing things in life can completely change how you feel about them!
qg65dl,hiftk8l,this is one of the funniest things I've read all month
qg65dl,hi7lw1l,Yeah I wouldn‚Äôt continue to pay $200 for this either. It‚Äôs a sunk cost for me so I‚Äôll keep it until I sell the car. I wonder how they‚Äôre going to handle sales actually.
qg65dl,hi75zip,"I'm kind of looking forward to that... Well, presuming the thing didn't actually commit a moving violation. ""the car is drunk, not me officer, I swear.""

Actually I'm going to start brining a camera with me to film any sort of driving it does. Because I'm sure I'm going to get nailed for running a stop sign, because FSD beta decided to stop 20ft before the stop sign then roll it once it actually decides to take a look around a corner."
qg65dl,hi5gyfj,"Weird, I've had the opposite experience. My car does lane centering pretty well, but it's too cautious at stop signs, and it has failed every roundabout I've encountered. It's crazy because I see it doing these things just fine in other beta videos. Maybe there isn't much training data for my area"
qg65dl,hi4qw8j,Cars should not drive in bike lanes full stop.
qg65dl,hi4f0ss,"Yeah, using it takes a lot of babysitting energy."
qg65dl,hi4gjgf,">  The best part is it defaults to 25MPH in the neighborhood

My small neighborhood speed limit is 15mph, but it still defaults to 25.  There are speed limit signs at both entrances that the car just seems oblivious to."
qg65dl,hi5n7yi,"I know this isn't the main issue, but the auto high beams have always been terrible."
qg65dl,hi50w63,"I discovered the ""Set speed to: Current"" option in the Autopilot menu.  That way if you're in a 15mph neighborhood and engage Autopilot it'll default to 10mph if you're going slow.   

I would get into that death spiral.  You disengage AP because it's going too fast (and had speed manually scrolled down to 15mph) and then you re-engage AP and it jumps back up to 25mph and you disengage.     This way at least when you re-engage at 15mph it stays at 15mph until it sees a speed limit sign."
qg65dl,hi55mek,">This is the problem with influencers being invited into beta. They have a vested interest in hype and manipulating their audience, especially those that are invested in Tesla as shareholders, but also simply because Tesla hype makes you money as a content creator.

A very good point and a great lesson for everyone when it comes to watching this kind of content and thinking it represents reality. The ability to mislead completely seamlessly can not be understated.

Tesla knows exactly what they are doing, sure they don't advertise, but when it comes to marketing in 2021 they are **THE** big player on the block. They do it more and better than anyone, it's their greatest strength and they will go down in history for their ability to do it.

For clarity, the best marketing strategies in 2021 are the ones that convince you there is no marketing. The absolute best ones are the ones where even the marketers don't actually think they are marketing, just acting in their own self-interest. This type of marketing is far far far more influential than traditional advertising."
qg65dl,hi51xvp,"Yep.  This is the problem with chasing the ""0 Disengagement Drive!"" which will attract 100,000 views.  Almost always those no disengagement drives are driving like someone who would blow a 0.2 BAC test."
qg65dl,hi6b0cf,"Teslas pretty much have mic and voice recognition already, no need for the phone.
But you do realize you‚Äôre doing so much for your own money, right? You should probably make a contract with Tesla so that they pay you since your approach is so meticulous."
qg65dl,hi5a0g6,"[It doesn't slow down for speed bumps](https://youtu.be/Z3LWl70ILOM?t=957)

[Left turns are fine with a lead car](https://youtu.be/Z3LWl70ILOM?t=1779)

[Right on red can be a bit sketchy though](https://youtu.be/Z3LWl70ILOM?t=2286)

Just depends on the area and variables involved."
qg65dl,hi5gx7q,"Today, on a straight road with two lanes in each direction and a turn lane in the middle, my 10.3.1 surged from the right lane into the left in an intersection and with no turn signal. Since there was no traffic nearby, I let it do that and hit the report button. Later on the same road, it was turning left and in the turn lane with the left turn signal on when it suddenly left the turn lane and moved right into the left lane, still with the left turn signal on. I reported that event and finished my drive on FSD but even more hyper aware than normal. 

Between those two events there were zero turns. FSD has been oscillating for me between amazing and horrible, and this makes me understand the extreme cautions given when giving someone access to FSD. 

Also, I think a lot of YouTubers have had there weird issues fixed, which is why FSD looks fantastic on their videos. This is why we have it now, to fix these problems."
qg65dl,hi5lhrh,"> and I am glad to not need to confirm every time i go through a green light

Do you still have to do this, with NOA?"
qg65dl,hi75gs3,[deleted]
qg65dl,hi6y4r4,I agree that it's pretty questionable if people should have this release. I'd much rather see them release this stack with  the same functionality as the existing stuff first.
qg65dl,hi4ddrr,I had a terrifying moment this morning when my car attempted the same.
qg65dl,hi4v8p5,Recalibrate your cameras
qg65dl,hiagknw,"Or, as another commenter suggested, two more cameras roughly where the headlights are, pointing outwards.  Provides much better visibility for turns, especially unprotected lefts."
qg65dl,hif7yxx,"I don't think we need a dome, but I think full FSD will need different hardware then we have now.  Mostly I wonder if the processor in the car will be enough."
qg65dl,hi603p6,"We don't actually know how close they might be because they don't release it like Tesla. FSD is nowhere even remotely close to ""FSD""."
qg65dl,hi52w9i,This is how I feel too.
qg65dl,hi5g96z,"Agreed. I don‚Äôt understand how people can say they‚Äôre ‚Äúunimpressed‚Äù when we‚Äôre literally in the future with the tech. Seems like it‚Äôs probably mostly people who don‚Äôt work in tech / understand how hard of a problem this is, but still‚Ä¶ this is so exciting."
qg65dl,hiahqwq,"Yes, it can make driving more stressful.  But it‚Äôs a chance to get a little taste of the future.  Given that many EV buyers are the sort who love gadgets and tech‚Ä¶ it isn‚Äôt surprising they want this."
qg65dl,hi77c7m,You can turn fsd on and off in auto pilot preferences.
qg65dl,hi9kgao,"If it makes you feel better, your radar-based autopilot will soon be vision-only too, if it isn't already."
qg65dl,hi4ws47,"My experience as well - the only thing I can come up with that might make this make a little more sense (because it drove so poorly for me)  is that perhaps when FSD beta finds itself in an entirely new area, relying solely on vision.... is needs to tag roads and intersections with metadata to characterize major road features.  Perhaps for many of the videos on youtube, those areas have already had this information generated (auto tagging?).  Some might call this HD map, but what I'm suggestion is general road properties far less sensitive to coordinates (for instance, a one way vs 2 way road)."
qg65dl,hi51eg4,Can more people please ask them to enlarge and move the snapshot record button lower and closer to the driver‚Äôs edge of the display? Annoying and at times unsafe to lean in reach to hit that tiny button every time it does something stupid which is on average 5 times every ten miles for me. Half the time I miss the button for the driver profiles instead.
qg65dl,hi54cyf,I'll definitely do all I can by sending clips in because I really do care about improving it.
qg65dl,hi54z69,"This post needs to be at the top.

Nav data is *clearly* stale as it has me trying to drive down my driveway to another street.  The driveway ends at my house.  And my house is 3 years old.  

But Uber drivers try to do the same, so I know it's old map data (I've since fixed is on OSM which I believe Uber still uses).

Also, people are complaining about it accelerating too fast through left/right turns.  You should have seen it in 10.2.  They've dramatically improved that.   Before, my tires would slip sometimes when making a right or left turn from a stop sign.  It's much better now.  

Snapshot often, email fsdbeta@tesla.com (with required info) when you have a good repeatable example of something bad and we can make it better.

Edit: bad wording"
qg65dl,hi4dujm,The middle of the road (even cutting corners and in oncoming lanes) thing I never saw in the videos but in person it feels so wrong and scared me a couple times. It's been making other cars uncomfortable and I had to disable a bunch.
qg65dl,hiafhow,"That‚Äôs true.  Although in this case, at least it‚Äôs clearly advertised as a beta.

Also in this case, I‚Äôm happy for the chance to try it early, without waiting for an official release.  Some say that other car companies are ahead of Tesla in FSD tech.  But while they may be ahead internally, they‚Äôre not releasing anything for consumers to play with _today_.  It‚Äôs cool to get to try it a few years early."
qg65dl,hi4p4ds,How do you do a camera recalibration?

Quite honestly this is the bullshit Tesla has been telling us for years now. Idk if you watched autopilot day, but they said such training would be occurring in the background for the last few years.

qg65dl,hi6s50o,"I‚Äôve had FSD beta since 10.2, and while it is a lot different from what I expected watching all of the vids on YouTube, part of my initial confusion on why it seemed to perform so terribly was actually me getting used to it driving a specific way that didn‚Äôt align with how I would do things. Over the next week or two, I lowered the speed limit differential to something I was more comfortable with in letting the car handle things on its own, and the disengagements I‚Äôve had lowered significantly. I think part of it is really getting used to how the car drives and what it tends to do in specific situations that differ from the way you are used to driving. Initially, any slight difference would cause me to disengage immediately just to ensure it didn‚Äôt do anything out of the ordinary.

If you watch Dirty Tesla‚Äôs videos he clearly documents his entire drives, and while there definitely are disengagements, he seems to somehow get away with a lot less than what I initially encountered with FSD beta. I‚Äôm not saying that after adjustments and getting a better feel to FSD beta it will drop disengagements down to zero, but I have personally noticed a lot less disengagements than when I first started.

IMO, this is a beta because it has all of the necessary components to do FSD:

* a perception system that tracks lanes, cars, drivable space, pedestrians, and other driving-related info like signs and construction zones
* a planning system that creates routes based on drivable space and other drivers/pedestrians intentions
* driver monitoring to ensure people are paying attention

qg65dl,hi5qz4n,"I am not saying don't post honest experiences. It's just that you have communicate with care and realize that we are in an environment where people are chomping at the bit to persecute Tesla based on anything taken out of context. The beta testing program being shut down would be bad for Tesla drivers, and bad for their safety long term because it will delay the advent of self-driving cars. I think everyone here wants Tesla to succeed, and wants the cars to be as safe as possible. The software currently has well-known issues, harping on them in public won't help that, Tesla is trying as hard as possible to fix them and the progress is stunning. If you have the beta, you can decide it's not safe enough for you and disable it, or continue to send the valuable data to  Tesla. Talking about the issues on a public forum is just going to invite negative attention (see already what forum crossposted this)."
qg65dl,hi6fj16,"If they provided a negative speed offset for only neighborhoods that would be great, but that doesn't exist."
qg65dl,hihm72r,‚Ä¶ and this isn‚Äôt unique to Tesla.  Tesla just has the fewest easy ways to overcome the issues.  Much easier problem when you can constrain it to a single city.
qg65dl,hifcy2n,That‚Äôs the most ironic part of all.  Makes sense for a beta though.  You are exactly who they want to help them train the models.
qg65dl,hja1qxe,"Exactly. The way it brakes and takes corners (even in Chill mode) is still extremely aggressive. Way more jerky than I've ever driven myself. It's so aggressive in Chill mode, it make my passengers uncomfortable."

qg65dl,hi7kd2f,"I am ALWAYS closer to the lane that has no car next to me. If both lanes have cars then that is the only time I am centered. It has always bothered me that autopilot stays in the center no matter what, even if there‚Äôs a huge semi to the right of me two inches into my lane and an empty lane to the left. In that scenario I like to drive almost a little inside the left lane to get as far away from that truck as I can, defensively. It seems like it should be an easy thing for Autopilot to do but they just don‚Äôt do it."

qg65dl,hi8uqxh,"At least in South Australia, the law is keep as left as practical (we drive in left lane). Yes, if there are parked cars you move out to give space, hence the ""as practical"". This is because oncoming cars are the most likely issue for you. The only time I sit right next to the centre line is when I am driving in the country where there is often wildlife. This gives a better view of potential animals that may run out. Even then, if there is an oncoming car, I move towards the left."
qg65dl,hi5giia,Mine probably the same. Haven't used it long enough to know for sure but I was impressed to see it move over a little when a large truck went by the other way.
qg65dl,hiag2bl,"Yeah, auto-brights w/ the FSD Beta basically make it impossible to use anywhere around where I live at night. I live at the edge of town, so there are lots of small town and county roads. Even driving through the edge of town where there are tons of street lights and stuff, brights will kick on. I dipped into a subdivision and it wouldn't drive without the brights on lmao. Nooooot okay!"
qg65dl,hiamdr5,"Hmmm... I've 100% tried to turn off the auto brights while using the FSD Beta and it does \*not\* turn them off. That said, I'm pretty sure it does for regular AP/NoAP, so maybe it's either specific to the FSD Beta or a bug in the current build?   
    
Either way, thanks for the heads up. That's what I expect(ed) the behaviour to be."
qg65dl,hiclu1d,"Yeah, boo, tried tonight and it's exactly what I remember. FSD Beta kicks on the brights obnoxiously, and if you pull back the L stalk to turn them off, the ""A"" disappears from the icon while you're pulling the stalk, but the brights don't turn off. As soon as you let go, the ""A"" comes back on the Auto Brights icon and there's still no change to the actual brights being on or off."

Ain't that the truth.  The funny thing I see is many people complained about ""granny driving"" to get into the beta and didn't realize that driving on Beta would be just the same if not worse (*narrator: it's worse*).

But for me, it's worth it.  I did a test last night where we have two roundabouts that are basically tied together.

FSD made it through better than humans I've seen attempt this intersection (hell, even me).  It's a new roundabout, and we don't have many where I live (north Bay Area)."
qg65dl,hi4e54h,I think that a lot too. That would be so valuable.
qg65dl,hi4suw0,That‚Äôs a very good point. If anything they should have kept a few people working on NOAP. There has been no updates to it in a while and the same interchange it failed when it was released are still a problem for me. I think Tesla still underestimate how long it will take to develop true ‚Äúfsd‚Äù. ‚Äî hate that name.
qg65dl,hi4z8h5,Yep. I've been saying that for 3 years.  This FSD white whale is a massive distraction from being able to hyper reliably drive in a straight line on the interstate.

qg65dl,hi60rhd,"THIS. A level 2 system for city streets is pretty worthless IMHO. Fun to play with for a bit but ultimately easier and less stressful to just drive yourself. Robotaxis are a decade away at best. A level 3 highway capable AP would be so much more useful and more attainable.

qg65dl,hi7jurm,"Come on! any day now this will be a L5 robotaxi system!

qg65dl,hi4te1x,"Try changing your FSD profile to assertive. If that's still not doing enough, time to start recording dumb moments for tesla to learn from.

This is not a product yet. This is training. If you don't like that, turn it off."
qg65dl,hi6fm2z,"Yep. I think the whole ""The AI is always training itself!"" thing is a gross misrepresentation (intentional or not) to keep people docile about the performance. Even *happy* about bad performance as you see in this thread. ""It almost ran into the crossing guard but I'm happy that I'm helping train it!"" 

By this point Tesla has *more* than enough training data to cover these edge cases that a single driver experiences 20 times per day. The list of misconceptions is long. To name a few...

""More data"" isn't a solution. It's a possible solution, when the problem is the lack of data. Even then the data can't just be a big lump of data you throw at the AI. It has to be properly tagged, categorized, and ingested, and even then there are no guarantees that you won't cause a regression. 

There is no or minimal real-time learning happening. The algorithms are baked in, and take a very long time to train on *much* more powerful hardware - like a compute farm. 

It doesn't matter how much data you have if the core architecture is fundamentally limited and incapable of achieving the desired performance. I don't agree with the idea that you can just take any algorithm/system and ""tune it"" to do whatever you want. Some systems and architectures are inherently limited and the only way to break those limits is to augment them with other systems or replace them altogether. A lizard will not learn to drive just because you feed its brain a trillion miles of self-driving data. It's fundamentally incapable of learning at that level.   

I would not be surprised in the least if one of the biggest AI breakthroughs of the century comes from some grad student's PhD thesis. Many advances, especially in software, come this way. More resources are always helpful but the most important thing is the core concept. Claude Shannon was one dude, and he single-handedly invented the entire field of information theory as well as proved most of its theorems. Just sayin'."
qg65dl,hi62m3q,"Autonomy day was in 2019.AI day was this year, and this year they detailed their NN is built to create a 4d space that they write code to drive the car with. The end goal is full NN decision-making. I think (speculation based on observed behavior) that right now they have a lot of code, and a few things that have NN path-making.

More speculation: Most cars right now cannot handle all the NN processing they're doing on just 1 chip. The purpose of having 2 chips in each car was to allow for shadow-mode that tried things in the background (For now, for later the idea was to run 2x models for redundancy). Today, I don't think that's possible with the current hardware limitations. As they improve their NNs, the size of them may decrease. But my current theory is that HW4 will be necessary for FSD release. For beta? HW3 is powerful enough, as long as they use both chips.

Edit: They may do small shadow-mode net predictions when the car is not on autopilot. This is more speculation, but clearly they NNs are separable, as they can run them on separate chips. But most likely, they're mostly requesting video data from the fleet (which is still really, really, really cool)."
qg65dl,hi593uh,"I don't believe the emails to FSDBeta after sending the clip is needed, just if the situation was like *super* bad, like your car got damaged, or you ran someone over."
qg65dl,hi7ceah,"It gets sent on wifi. Tesla can request specific situations from the fleet, and the fleet records that data and uploads when you get home.

But that's just the fleet. For FSD, whenever you disengage with the brake or with the wheel, it automatically records. And you can hit the record button for other times. These are uploaded and some are reviewed. I imagine it's filtered by event type."

qg65dl,hi74gsy,"Watching the visualization, you can tell that car really can see well around it. Doing something with what it sees is where it needs a ton of work."
qg65dl,hi7ky6y,"Yeah I feel like regular AP with the traffic light control would actually brake earlier and feel less crazy. Hopefully over the next year or so it becomes less bad.

Some edge cases though I can‚Äôt imagine will be solvable anytime soon. It was making a left turn for me today, an easy one with a green turning signal and all. A lady jogging stepped off the sidewalk maybe 2 feet to wait in the pedestrian crosswalk but because she continued to **jog in place** to keep her heartrate up the car thought she was running into the crosswalk and slammed the brakes and then just stayed there stopped. It stopped long enough that she actually started waving for me to go and I ended up intervening and just going. Luckily nobody was turning behind me or it‚Äôd be a rear ending risk. 

But that‚Äôs one of those things where a computer is going to have a super hard time knowing that this lady wasn‚Äôt actually jogging forward despite her moving her legs like she was running. To a vision AI it looks a lot like she‚Äôs running towards us and if you train a NN ignore this scenario it‚Äôll likely be worse at stopping for actual people running into the street."
qg65dl,hi74zrh,"Yes, but having some sort of conservative physics model to sanity check against would be useful. The damn thing tried to take a TIGHT 90* exit last night at 60mph. It's marked 15mph, and would have failed if I didn't intervene. Old NOAP would have hit the breaks at least."
qg65dl,hid36a2,The problem with other companies that they dont have much training data.. Now Tesla solved the 3D space and auto labeling - means that huge amount of training data is available and will make the remaining task done.
qg65dl,hi4wnf4,Decades? Lol they switched to pure vision a few months ago.. relax sparky
qg65dl,hi8nra6,"Yup, I might have been explaining it weirdly. Thank you for mentioning it/clarifying.

They have: vision, planning, control.

Vision utilises ResNets + Tranformers
Control is traditional coding.
But planning, isn't just code by hand, they have search algorithms that they use to optimize the result with. They converge to the ""best"" solution as the algorithms deem to be right.

Though, the planner bases everything on what the system ""sees"". 

They're also beginning to use NNs for planning, but debating about needing it everywhere or just with summon/auto park (as mentioned from the AI Day).

It's not as easy as to just ""make it work"". Vision needs to be tuned, and they need something that works everywhere, a *global* solution. The planner bases everything on what it ""sees"", and they're trying to optimize even further with mixing in ML in some parts of the planner (auto park etc). The control part is very much so hand coded.

The search algorithms for the planner are ""hand-coded"", but it's not same as some simple if statements. The search algorithms need to account for a lot of parameters, and find the optimal solution. Certain search algorithms do very often get stuck in *local* solutions (local min.) - and that's not good."
qg65dl,hi5gu5u,"My point was that he changed ""fuck, FSD beta is borderline useless!"" into ""that was a fun mini game to play for 60 days""."

qg65dl,hi5bfug,"They don't use OpenStreetMaps anymore.  They never used it for speed limits, but they've gone from Valhalla to MapBox when MapBox bought Valhalla, so we don't have a direct means of updating their navigation information.

qg65dl,hi57wx5,"Completely agree.

Generally, people won't act in this manner for a product that is truly bad, which is great. But that does not forgive the blatant lying from people who have massive personal incentives. Whether that is due to stock holdings, being granted something by Tesla which makes them money due to being watched, granted free roadsters, etc it does not matter.

qg65dl,hi7tw3i,FSD 10.2 is the beta.
qg65dl,hi7blzj,"So...autopilot then? Because FSD beta and autopilot are different things. AP comes with your car. FSD beta you have to qualify and be selected for. I think we just want to make sure we're all taking about the same program. If you're referring to AP, then your comments are an accurate description.  FSD beta wouldn't completely fit what you're describing."
qg65dl,hi56bo3,"Never hurts to recalibrate the cameras, just to be sure."
qg65dl,hi64lx0,"I honestly only think it's useful on highways anyway. I don't see a point in using it in anything remote residential or urban.  

90% isn't good enough for robotaxis like Tesla plans though. They would constantly get stuck all over the place."
qg65dl,hia1t19,"I could SWEAR that it has, but I can't find any hard information as to what version if so. As an interesting aside re:phantom braking, it's genuinely amazing how variable and self-contradictory the FCW performance is, regardless of radar vs vision:

qg65dl,hi5o2ur,"Do you have any links to info about them doing this? Or is this just your own supposition?

The one critical thing I've felt their approach to FSD to be missing when compared to a human driver is memory. Like, if a car is only visually trying to interpret some confusing intersection it is prone to always making the same mistakes. A human can remember what they need to do, and breeze right through after having experienced it a couple times. A fleet memory of all intersections, potholes, etc. would be amazing, but I haven't seen yet any reliable information indicating they are looking at an approach like this in the near or long term, or whether it's even considered feasible."
qg65dl,hi5jizj,"I think this is really the best way they can handle cases like parking garages as well. SLAM would allow them to automatically map out and location-find the cars within something like an enclosed parking garage (no GPS, a barometer may or may not be accurate enough to determine which floor you're on). 

The alternative would be for them to get FSD to understand signs so well that they ""know"" the way out or around based on signage, but understanding both language and pictograms in generalized cases is probably significantly harder than just doing what robot vacs have been doing for years."
qg65dl,hi50iuv,"The logic for when to do lane changes is still atrocious even if the execution is vastly improved.  That's one of the more depressing and discouraging parts of Autopilot development.   I see things like ""When I should change lanes"" being such an incredibly simple problem compared to ""Drive anywhere a human can"" and it's strikes out on the basics.   E.g. sitting with its blinker on long before there is any chance of actually changing lanes instead of just sitting and waiting until traffic thins enough.  Or seeing a truck fast approaching in the right lane and not getting out of the passing lane.   Or just sitting in the passing lane.  Or randomly changing lanes for rando ""Follow the route"" lane changes for no reason.  Or seeing that traffic is heavy ahead, so changing into the exit lane while it still can easily.

It's a bit like the automatic windshield wipers.   If hard coded rules and AI can't solve a tiny subset of the driving problem well.  What hope do they have of solving the entire driving problem any time soon?"

qg65dl,hi56oe6,"Believe it or not it's tied to the road types on OpenStreetMaps.org.

World Dr at Disney World in Florida, for example, is a regular ""surface"" road, but it's listed as a ""Motorway"" in OSM, and so you end up driving along World Dr using the traditional Autopilot instead of FSD Beta.  I wasn't expecting that when I did that."

qg65dl,hi580b6,"I agree with you about driving in the middle, but FSD in its current state does not slow down and move over soon enough when an oncoming car becomes visible. Also, when going through a curve where my line of sight is more limited, there will be less time to react to an oncoming car. I would like it to be biased more to the side rather than being directly in the middle in this case, and also to slow down a bit. Speed needs to adjust with conditions rather than always being 25 mph."
qg65dl,hi4vpju,"with respect man you just don't know what you're talking about. it drives in the middle of many unmarked roads that are clearly wide enough for it to be in the right lane. i've lived in my neighborhood for 25 years. no one drives like this.  what's worse, tesla will not get over to the right lane until the very last possible moment, swerving violently to the right when it sees an oncoming car. it does this even around blind curves in the road. it is terrifying and obviously unacceptable"
qg65dl,hii6rin,Yeah. I live in a small town. Pretty much self driving on road the car has never seen before.  In that respect it was pretty awesome.
qg65dl,hi7lzr9,"I think this is personal preference/habit. I grew up in rural places, but I always aligned myself with the left lane line. I don‚Äôt ‚Äúhug‚Äù it, but I by default keep a fixed distance from it, regardless of how far the right lane line is. Of course I will shift over if there‚Äôs some reason to (wide load, bad driver crossing the line or making me nervous)."
qg65dl,hi77rvv,"Yeah, it annoys me that it always centers even when the right side is actually a parking lane. It should split the width in half since it's actually 2 lanes and then center on that. Insted it is always driving in the center and then weaves around any parked cars even though the road is straight."
qg65dl,hi5fgzk,"That's bad driving.  I've never hugged a shoulder, even on rural roads.  You're supposed to be centered in your lane."
qg65dl,hi5mq0z,"I'd rather be more toward the shoulder than the center line as well. Everyone is going to have a preference, but I don't understand the idea of wanting to hug a center line, I'm putting trust in other drivers not to creep over the center, whereas if I'm towards the shoulder I don't have oncoming traffic to concern myself with as much."
qg65dl,hi5hhig,"Defensive driving shouldn't be riding the shoulder.  If people are taking a turn too sharp, be aware of it and slow down going in to the turn.  I've never hugged a shoulder taking a turn out of concerned of being nailed by someone crossing a yellow."
qg65dl,hi5f7rh,"With, or without Autopilot?  Because I'm typically always centered.  They teach you to keep your eyes on the distant horizon of the road to help keep yourself centered."
qg65dl,hig6m7i,"Try pushing (away from you, not towards you) the stalk next time, just real quick. I know, it's anti-intuitive because that's typically how you turn brights on... but it's also how you turn brights off when they're on... so who knows! I'm hoping to get FSD beta this weekend so I can join the pool of testers and provide useful information"
qg65dl,hi6ysmn,"It sucks at actual city driving as well. Or well, any city that's in practice over 100 years old. It's super scary on narrow city streets."
qg65dl,hi7pzh9,"Currently, city driving is at least like 1 intervention (taking over steering) per mile, at least with my regular drives, especially when there are enough other cars around. I‚Äôd have said the opposite, suburbs with little traffic and wide roads must be ideal lol"
qg65dl,hidyj7n,"Ha! That‚Äôs fantastic really.  I live in Arizona, so for the most part everything is straight and relatively simple design wise.  I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing how it does.

The safety score has honestly taught me a ton about my driving and I think changed some things for good too.  Just tiny tweaks I realize.  Though I‚Äôll be happy to go back to slightly more fun driving and just not having people be so mad at me on turns and such."
qg65dl,hi5lvf1,"To be fair, it sounds like they have but the bar is a little higher there. NOA is already not terrible, so the new version has to be better upon release.

qg65dl,hi5rrcc,"I dont think they are underestimating how long true fsd will be. 

This is why they are working on it now. Get their AI to start to work and lay the foundation for true fsd."
qg65dl,hi56xb7,"Agreed.

A real level 3 highway system would be massive, not one that only works at low speeds one that actually works at the speeds people drive on real roads.

I think the general public would agree too. Sure FSD is way sexier, and that is largely to blame for its ""white whale"" status as you described. But it's incredibly telling that the software which seems way way way more reasonable to deliver is not even in the reasonable pipeline.

<Look over here> should not be working this long."
qg65dl,hi5r86h,"Their software design direction has always been an ""shoot for the moon"" approach. If they solve FSD, then straight-line interstate is trivial. However, if you work solely on highway perfection, you aren't any closer to actual FSD."

qg65dl,hi78s4o,"I truly think to have full autonomy, the car will need to both reference a previously generated 3D model of its surroundings (think 3D google street view with depth data) as well as use it‚Äôs cameras to position itself in that model and adapt to variables. Training AI is one thing but relying purely on well marked roads or lead cars only gets so far. 

In this hypothetical system you would put in your destination and the car would stream data as you go, maybe even store frequent routes. The fleet could frequently update these models for things like road construction and expand the model just by driving around. Everyone contributes to the model and accesses the data, strengthening it over time. Unfortunately LiDAR sensors would be necessary for this and unless Elon has a change of heart it won‚Äôt happen."

qg65dl,hi8aal1,"FSD Beta should be called City Streets Beta. New Owners and folks not up to speed may confuse AP with FSD Beta and attempt driving with AP in a manner they see on YouTube videos. Also, FSD Beta is not intended to be used in parking lots, shopping centers or community driveways yet."

qg65dl,hia35k7,"I thought radar less cars still had the follow distance 2 and 80mph top speed limitations? I don't have those. Also, how well does Tesla vision ""see"" two cars ahead? My car still shows two cars ahead based on what I can only assume is radar data, because it will correctly spot a small car completely obscured by a bigger one. I am quite certain if/when they make the change to Tesla vision it will be obvious. I am not a fan of their decision to remove radar in the first place. Cameras can get obscured, bad weather, fog, etc... Vision only will never be as safe. Period."
qg65dl,hi5qdth,"Supposition based on AI Day information.

I do know that they used to use Valhalla for mapping, and then MapBox bought Valhalla and now they use MapBox.

Valhalla used to consume OpenStreetMaps data, and that data pretty much got imported in to MapBox.

I've done write ups comparing my FSD Beta drives to OSM data:

https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/q9npq7/fsd_beta_102_observations_day_2/

https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/qc14le/fsd_beta_102_another_driving_experience_write_up/

https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/qec3zf/fsd_beta_102_goes_to_disney_world/ - Pretty sure most folks skipped this one because I took it to Disney, but honestly it points out a great number of behaviors.

There's also a whole YouTube thing I did that goes with the Disney one: https://youtu.be/Z3LWl70ILOM - It's long as shit because I spent 90 minutes driving around Disney property, but when you compare notes with OSM, it's pretty obvious we're dealing with stale navigation data.

During AI Day there was this bit: https://youtu.be/j0z4FweCy4M?t=4132 which shows their predictions of what the roads look like.  If you keep watching he talks about how multiple cars could navigate the area and build an HD map of the roads.

https://youtu.be/j0z4FweCy4M?t=5420 - This bit during AI day talks about how the cars were picking up different segments of the same road, then when you layer them you get an idea as to what the roads look like, again, ""Tesla driving around = Tesla mapping everything out for everyone else""

I think a lot of people missed just how ""Lay it all out for them"" Tesla was during AI Day, I mean, you look at this bit here: https://youtu.be/j0z4FweCy4M?t=4973 and you're like ""Oh hey, it's navigating in a parking lot"", but that's actually FSD Beta today.  That's the damn tentacle that's in front of everyone's cars at the moment.  I don't see that connection being made very often.

Then there's this AI Day bit here: https://youtu.be/j0z4FweCy4M?t=6015 which goes on to talk about how they use the clips to generate a simulation of what happened.

2021.36 appears to do some voxel representations as well now: https://twitter.com/rice_fry/status/1447384328304922631?s=21 

So, to me, when you piece all this together it just reads as Tesla leveraging all Teslas to create maps that ""maintain themselves"" as long as Teslas are driving around.  FSD or not all Teslas are basically going to become contributors to making FSD work.

That's my interpretation.  It's my own supposition, but based on a lot of information that's out there."
qg65dl,hi5jyr5,"I suspect their end game is to just read signs.  I mean, honestly it shouldn't be *that* complicated.  Most roads have a sign indicating where they are.

Honestly construction zones are the harder ones to handle."
qg65dl,hi8aynz,"It's the Amazon Assistant problem all over again.  


They implement an amazingly high quality voice recognition system and then fail to sit down one or two apprentices to figure out ways people ask questions and make it feel natural. You still have to talk just right, and say just the right things for them to do what you want. Which is why most voice assistants are designated alarm clocks/play radio devices >90% of the time.  


Or look at phones, they have so many incredible features. But a simple 'remind me to pick up apples next time I am at the grocery store' ... nope, never works reliably."
qg65dl,hi53eji,"I mean, most of the issues I think relate to camera quality.  There's only so much quality the cameras get you to guess the speed of oncoming vehicles.

qg65dl,hi5cz5a,"> Your comment sounded like there's a whole other version that's out there besides the Beta that people have/are being invited to participate in.

No, just the one that's being iterated on.  It's Beta for early access.  Until they roll it wide for everyone regardless of score, then consider it still early access/beta testing."
qg65dl,hi56606,"I actually laughed when I looked in ""Autopilot"" menu on the car.  Like everything in there is beta.  Pretty bad.  I mean, the shit works, but at some point I feel like they need to shit or get off the pot and just release a v1"
qg65dl,hi5g7mv,True but beta means two different things here: a beta feature vs a beta program. Everyone who has received the FSD update has been admitted to the EAP early access program aka beta program as per Tesla‚Äôs email
qg65dl,hi5iuz1,I don't see any straight line difference between FSD and AP besides I no longer need to confirm for traffic lights (sometime I had to confirm multiple times) and it no longer go crazy when there's a flashing yellow
qg65dl,hi5us1g,"No worries. It seems like most of the criticism about Tesla's progress stems from some fundamental errors of thought regarding the complexity of human behavior. The fact is, under real world conditions, there are no simple behaviors or actions, because no action occurs in a vacuum. In order to drive safely the AI can't just blindly follow the rules, as that would guarantee an accident. It has to know the rules, but in a split second, be able to operate outside of them and essentially ""think"" for itself. The requirement for the cars to be able to ""think"" for themselves introduces an enormous amount of complexity and variety to how they perform basic functions, and with that complexity and variety comes mistakes. As Elon Musk has said, they are basically creating ""semi-sentient robots on wheels"". In fact, the humanoid robots they are creating will make use of the same AI used to drive their cars. The problem they are solving isn't merely how to navigate the roadways of our world, but how to behave and navigate within any physical space, autonomously. That's not an easy thing to accomplish."
qg65dl,hi548jl,"It's just so telling when people act that way.

qg65dl,hi90tkm,"Yeah, it's pretty obvious.  I made another post elsewhere about a stretch of highway that changes from a NOA to FSD just at a stoplight.  

It's the same road, but map-wise it's classified differently on one side of the stoplight vs. the other.  And the Tesla will switch depending on which side of the stoplight you're on.

It's *very* interesting to see the differences in behavior of the car while on FSD/NOA as it changes (hint: FSD is *much* better).

Edit: Here's an example of [the intersection](https://imgur.com/a/arc4GYG) I'm talking about.  The classifications are from OpenStreetMaps.org which Tesla originally based their map data off of, but apparently they are using MapBox now, which started off with a dump of OSM (or some such thing)."
qg65dl,hi59jcd,That is certainly an issue and not the portion I was trying to address. Sorry for the lack of clarity.
qg65dl,hi57y07,"Apparently, the one I'm daily driving is completely different.

qg65dl,hi5izvi,"On roads like he‚Äôs talking about, where a painted yellow line is all that separates you from a semi truck going 70mph in the other direction‚Ä¶  I‚Äôll hug the shoulder when a car goes by in the opposite direction, but stay centered in the lane otherwise."
qg65dl,hi6l5v9,"This is very location specific. Here's a location where it is so common even Google's streetview captured it: [https://www.google.com/maps/@40.2684439,-75.1126357,3a,41.3y,92.07h,92.39t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sOXYcCSSXfa4JgXatFOwcfQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.2684439,-75.1126357,3a,41.3y,92.07h,92.39t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sOXYcCSSXfa4JgXatFOwcfQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656)

&#x200B;

If you go up and down that road a little bit, and change the street view year however you'll like, you'll see that a good portion of the cars going one way come close to crossing the line (and in practice actually cross it). you'll also see that this is so common that cars going the other direction are almost all biased towards the shoulder."

qg65dl,higcdp9,"LMAO I think I owe you dinner. Every single car I've ever owned in my life you would pull the stalk back halfway for momentary brights or all the way to a click to turn them on or off.

I suppose it doesn't help that in 3 years of ownership, I've never once needed to turn the brights on. D'oh."

Again, I'm not a frequenter of roundabouts.  Others on here would probably laugh at this!"
qg65dl,hi9jn5e,If that were true then all of their work on beta 10.2 would be useless for 10.3.    There is a ton of carry-over development.    FSD and EAP both need to detect cars and their positions.  Both FSD and EAP need to detect lanes and cones etc.

qg65dl,hi76083,I think it was for Tesla insurance.
qg65dl,hidltvr,What do you think which is harder? train someone to drive or to play go? and the second problem is already solved for AI. Driving in general is not super hard to do - what is hard is to detect the environment where the driving skills can be applied - I guess
qg65dl,hi5amqz,"And, perhaps not by entire coincidence, Tesla doesn‚Äôt need to purchase the radar hardware.

The phantom braking thing is just weird. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a problem unique to Tesla‚Äôs architecture, but weird nonetheless.

I do recall a Car and Driver article from ~2014 or so where a Genesis (I think, it was for sure a Kia/Hyundai product) where an instance of what I imagine is the same failure mechanism as ‚Äúphantom braking‚Äù happened to the car on the highway, and the car slammed on the brakes and stopped entirely. I thought that was damn dangerous at the time, but here I am now owning a Kona EV and I haven‚Äôt experienced any problems like it (yet), so I‚Äôm assuming the cause was ironed out."
qg65dl,hi5o1r5,"Who said they don‚Äôt like babysitting it? It takes dedicated mental energy and vigilance to test this beta, as it would with any other beta, and you basically need to be QA for Tesla.

qg65dl,hi612oo,"I would still keep updating OSM, but in the long haul I'm fairly positive they're going to just pull data from the fleets and generate their maps that way"
qg65dl,hi5r5vn,"Ah I was just relaying my experience from 10.2 and 10.3.1. It often signals correctly, but I‚Äôve driven through a construction zone and it kept trying to signal left into the cones to avoid the slow traffic in front of me. It would then realize there‚Äôs cones and cancel the signal. Then on the next gap between cones, it would start its signal again. It‚Äôs fairly erratic."
qg65dl,hi5xte7,"What an amazing response. Thank you, will definitely be perusing your links this evening!


Really hoping your suppositions are correct, would be amazing for one car to be able to learn of a new pothole and teach an entire fleet how to avoid it!"

qg65dl,hibain8,"You don't think their lidar like models from the cameras are enough? From the videos they have shown it looks identical to the cloud maps I've seen with lidar.

If anything I think there will be camera upgrades to incorporate thermal imaging. Elon recently said the AP 2.0 cameras will be upgraded (included with the FSD package at any price) and he has spoken highly of thermal before."
qg65dl,hi76r94,">The phantom braking thing is just weird. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a problem unique to Tesla‚Äôs architecture, but weird nonetheless.

I've had two Ford vehicles with radar based ACC (but no AEB) and they've never once phantom braked."
qg65dl,hi5tc52,"The cone stuff is interesting behavior.  Hasn't changed in 10.3.1, but [in this bit here](https://youtu.be/Z3LWl70ILOM?t=4416) I point out that the vehicle has a tendency to leave a fairly hefty gap between the vehicle and the cone.

The clip is an acceptable example because you should be able to see that it pushes me to the right, away from the cones, by a good foot or two.

This is an issue when driving down a road with barrels on one side because the vehicle puts me over the lines and in to oncoming traffic, at least until oncoming traffic approaches, then it centers me again, but for a brief period in time, I come across as the asshole who can't maintain my lane."
qg65dl,hi5z9x0,"That is exactly what I'm expecting from the system once they get going.

qg65dl,hi7kdyh,"Nah, I‚Äôve seen oncoming semis veer like 4 feet into my lane so this is suicide if you just stay centered."
qg65dl,hibbd9c,Risk? I've done it twice. It's quick and works like it is supposed to. First time was from Tesla not doing it themselves after a windshield replacement üòí
qg65dl,hibjwho,"The resulting model might look similar but the path to get there does not. LiDAR gives you fast, sub-cm accurate distances to objects 100 meters away, cameras do not. Resolving things accurately at those distances, with relatively wide-angle cameras, requires very high resolutions as well as sufficient parallax between 2+ cameras, since one camera alone can't give you that information. 

The only real reason to ignore LiDAR is cost and software complexity. The former is becoming less of an issue every day. The latter is a moot point, given the complexity of FSD and the resources put into it, and yet it still can't figure out how to not run into large stationary objects. Of course, if instead of saying ""LiDAR isn't technologically feasible for us yet"" you say ""LiDAR is for DOPES and anyone who uses it is an IDIOT ahahaha"" as Elon does, it gets a little trickier to reverse that stance later on down the line.

As for thermal, it'd enable a couple of interesting features but I'd be very surprised if Tesla incorporated that any time soon. For one, thermal imaging sensors with sufficient resolution to be useful are expensive. If you're augmenting the cameras you'd need like 12 sensors that each cost several hundred dollars. For two, I don't really see a way you could incorporate them. They work on entirely different wavelengths and require different optics. Glass is opaque to thermal IR. It would require substantial modifications to the car/camera systems - particularly the front-facing cameras behind the windshield.

If they're just talking about adding a single front-facing thermal imager to the car like some other OEMs have done, that's much more straightforward. Helpful in fog and for spotting people/deer at night. And cops..."
qg65dl,hi7pnd5,"Yeah and as I mentioned I haven‚Äôt had it happen either. So it seems like most companies have ID‚Äôed the root cause, it‚Äôs just a mystery why it‚Äôs still an issue with Tesla"
qg65dl,hibinoa,It‚Äôs not the driving 100 miles like original calibration?
qg65dl,hidlobk,They could just be removing the IR filter from the new cameras just like on the Comma 3 by Comma AI for improved night vision.
qg65dl,hiblczq,Yes it's the one that claims it could take 100 miles. Each time it never needed more than 15 miles for me. Make sure to drive around on well marked roads and it will go quickly. An AP like icon appears with a ring around it showing how far along it is. The ring will fill in to show percentage.
qg65dl,hiedvog,"Those filters are near-infrared, not the same as thermal IR. I suppose they might help night vision by letting in a tiny bit more light. Normally cameras like that use NIR illuminators so that they can still see but the light isn't visible to humans."

eoso3q,fefmkzr,"I had the same issues as you.  There was no ""Add a car"" option

I talked on the online chat - they had to open up a request and sent me the info.  The information you would send to transfer a vehicle is sent to 

changeofownershipna@tesla.com

But you need to open a request with customer service first I think.

This is what is requested: 

Color¬†copy or photo of your current driver‚Äôs license or state/province ID.

Copy or photo of your title or registration.

If registering under a business, please include your business card with your name and name of the business

Email address you would like linked to your Tesla Account¬†(your Tesla Account email if you have an existing account)

Full VIN

Home or mailing address

Phone number

Was your vehicle purchased from a private party or 3rd¬†party dealership?"
eoso3q,fef1bjw,"Try both. Or whatever is closer. I went to a SC, they scanned in my relevant documents. Then I confirmed them using the online portal another poster linked, then followed up with emails. Took less than two weeks

No. I'm not very patient. Thanks for asking"
eoso3q,fef6rh7,Not familiar with any SCs outside of the one near me. (Qu√©bec City.)
eoso3q,fefxvjl,The previous owner are supposed to do that.
eoso3q,feey5tp,"Sell doesn't have to do anything. 

You should just have to send a picture of your current active registration and bill of sale."
eoso3q,fef40ry,The Tesla account is pretty baron until you actually get a car connected to it. Then account settings become available.
eoso3q,fef5op6,"Thanks for the suggestions, but I can't see anything anywhere that gives me the option to add the car. The support rep I was chatting with as well was coaching me to that point and basically gave up when I said I didn't see anything like that."
eoso3q,fefra4j,"Did this week's ago with all this info.
Bought from dealership."
eoso3q,fef1uov,Went to a service centre and they told me to email customersupport@tesla.com and I sent an email and I got an auto response saying that it is not being monitored.
eoso3q,fef1s0k,Sent all this information and still haven't gotten any response for weeks.
eoso3q,feeyb4e,"Odd. I‚Äôve seen several of these posts where people have said Tesla customer service hasn‚Äôt been prompt in transitioning them over tho?

I wonder what else could be done to speed up or prevent the delay?"
eoso3q,fefbnny,Barren. A Baron is a person of significant nobility.

eoso3q,fef70a6,I've done that before and they've referred me to send an email to customersupport@tesla.com and I sent an email to that inbox and I got an auto reply that the inbox isn't being monitored anymore
eoso3q,fef7n77,"I was definitely thinking about doing this. I'd rather not have to do something so ludicrous to get this done. Also, it may not work at all."
eoso3q,fefw84b,"Just tried this. Don't see anything about adding another car. 
Gonna cancel and hopefully get my refund this year."
eoso3q,fefaqox,That is annoying. There should be a better system when you buy from another owner (and that owner may not care)
eoso3q,fef9f88,It‚Äôs refundable so might as well. Although refund may take forever.
eoso3q,feft600,"It should definitely work. I only have a Cybertruck in my account.

7w64ms,dty1byt,"As an attorney, how do you feel about this AP2 situation:

1) Test drive, read marketing material, and manual for an AP1 car.

2) Order an AP1 car before AP2 is released

3) Get email saying I am being changed to an AP2 car. If I want, upgrade to EAP, which adds features in the future. Either way, the car will be ""delivered with AP1 features"" that I paid for as part of my original order.

4) Get car, find out that not even cruise control works, and there are no rain sensing wipers. Was not told of this before or during vehicle delivery.

5) 65 weeks later, car still doesn't do what an AP1 car did

6) User manual online is still AP1, no way for a new buyer to find out what the car can and cannot do in writing.

7) At the time I paid for EAP, the marketing materials said ""expected December 2016."" Now, 60 weeks later, this still has not been released, but Tesla refuses to refund money.

This is a very different situation- they actually took people's money for these cars, and they don't do what the marketing materials or manuals say. "
7w64ms,dtxrkg9,"Are a lot of people here claiming to want to sue Tesla? Moreso I see disappointed buyers who are either priced out because of missing the tax credit, or can't afford to wait an additional 3-6+ months every time there is a schedule slip. Worst case that I've seen repeatedly is backing out of the sale, which is honestly a better signal to Tesla than a lawsuit, and much cheaper for the consumer.

Colloquial use of ""bad-faith"" is different than a legal usage, but then so are most terms that are thrown around willy-nilly."
7w64ms,dty30dv,"> You're holding a place in line

Except you don't know where in the line, or even what line.  And the line gets reshuffled underneath you opaquely without notice."
7w64ms,dtydkq6,"Not having ""bad faith"" in the legal sense is not all the relevant if you are perceived to have ""bad faith"" in the consumer space.

Delaying the long-promised $35k car to 2019 - and let's be honest, they're doing this because they can't afford to lose money on the $35k version so they can't afford to ship it - is unlikely to be legal bad faith since the deposits are fully refundable. 

But it sure looks like shit in the consumer spaces.

It will also be interesting to see if there are repercussions with investors...who knows what nudge nudge wink wink stories were told the big debt buyers. And at some point the smart money is going to start asking why the margins supposedly enabled by the Gigafactory aren't actually showing up.

Anyway - I'm not a shareholder - and I can cancel my reservation any time a better product comes on the market - so I'm not stressing over it.
"
7w64ms,dty1cmw,"I've actually not see the term ""bad faith"" used at all here till reading your title post.  "
7w64ms,dtypt5z,"This is mostly unrelated, but I'm curious what your opinion would be on certain kickstarters. 

Here's the scenario: people back the Kickstarter for a given product. Some people get their product delivered, some are still waiting. And then the company starts selling the product on its website. A new buyer could purchase one and have it in a week, but the original backer is left waiting. 

And after years, they are still waiting. The company has released a version two. 

Would this count as bad faith, in your opinion? "
7w64ms,dtxx5gm,[deleted]
7w64ms,dtxtl8a,"I agree with your points. I am pre-reveal reservation holder and willing to wait some more. 

But, some of us regard Tesla and especially Elon as a more than a business and more than a businessman. That scale brings blind faith and with the same scale hurts when they do something less than expected. It goes both ways. 

So while you are spot on, from legal point of view; It‚Äôs beyond that, for better or for worse.

I continue to have faith! I am excited with larger picture. "
7w64ms,dtxwhqo,"I never saw anyone say that. I am, however, a fanboy that is disillusioned by the whole series of events. I would throw out the phrase bait and switch, not legally, but ethically. If tesla did plan to sell us a 35K car, then why, in the long, long period of time we have been waiting, have we not even been given a glimpse of the SR model 3? Not even a peek? I sold part of my stock before market opening, but I'm still holding onto my reservation and and the majority of my stock.

 Hopefully, they do something to make things right. I can afford the SR car without the rebate, but I am far from rich enough to do so without heavily justifying the decision based on that rebate. Maybe the AWD version will be an affordable stand alone upgrade thay could be justified? I don't know, since they haven't even announced how much it is yet."
7w64ms,dty7kz8,"I was disappointed at first, but now I got a chance to consider AWD instead of just RWD, I am happy again."
7w64ms,dtzs39w,"While clearing demonstrating a handle on the issue at hand there is a glaring error in your post. 

His title is  *Grand Moff Tarkin*

Otherwise I agree. I waited in line day one and put down the money sight unseen.  I'll wait until I don't want to wait any longer and worst case i'll get my $1,000 back.  It's cash reserves anyway so it would be a bit much to worry about ""opportunity cost"", especially when owed exactly nothing.  "
7w64ms,dtxveln,I assume its mostly just paid hoping to add x amount of key words and manipulate the stock for an hour or a day.
7w64ms,dty3wdv,">Bad Faith: intentional dishonest act

I think a lot of states right now are looking really hard at all of the tax benefits that they're handing out to Model 3 purchasers.  There benefits in a few states that offer discounts on ""EVs with starting prices under <$35k"". 

I'm sure there is at least one attorney general now looking at the new delivery estimates and wondering if the model 3 should still qualify or if Tesla enticed buyers with a price that doesn't really exist, and may not exist for a long time. "
7w64ms,dtxre91,Thank you! I‚Äôve been thinking this after reading all of the posts you mention and I‚Äôm glad someone who knows what they are talking about made this post.

7w64ms,dtyaz4q,"that's why people don't trust lawyers, doctors, mechanics. I like Tesla the fact that they don't do massive recall like the rest."
7w64ms,dtxxg8l,"Often in silicon valley leaders will set very aggressive goals... Knowing that the teams will achieve maybe 70% of the way there and that the result is good. Sun, Google, Tesla and others are good examples of this.

The difference between Sun, Google and Tesla is that Tesla's publishes these goals as things that will happen... And consistently they don't happen in the timeframe listed by the goal. The other companies don't publish such goals because they don't want to cause disappointment.

Does Elon know that his claims are stretch goals for the team that will only be 70% achieved in the given time? I think so. Is it bad faith when Elon announces them and doesn't call them stretch goals? Maybe?

As someone in possession of a Tesla leased with full self driving paid for, where the lease started not long after the famous 3 month 6 month tweet, should I expect something from Tesla if I never get full self driving during my lease?"

7w64ms,dtyate0,"Also, I'm sure many of us know this, but because the EV tax credit is not a refundable one, you may not necessarily get the full use of it.  Do not count the $7500 or $3750 or whatever as yours until you hit submit on turbotax."
7w64ms,dtygat5,"I think what you‚Äôre saying is they were operating in bad faith in your situation. The interesting thing about claiming good/bad faith is that it‚Äôs really hard to prove because it has to do with intent. The question you need to ask is do you think Tesla sold you an AP1 with the intention of selling you an AP2 all along or was there unforeseen circumstances that required them to switch your vehicle to an AP2. If you believe in the former, then yes, that is acting in bad faith. The next step would be to prove it. "
7w64ms,dtyk3fo,"are people actually talking about legal definitions or just mad that tesla has constantly over promised and under delivered? he said $35,000 car but its actually $49,000. they could have produced the smaller version of the battery in the order they said but they are going to produce the AWD next adding the base to $54,000. its bad faith to continue to push off the car. 

i understand were all fan boys but saying they havent acted in bad faith is drinking the kool ade after watching them pour a strange liquid in it. "

I'm not really expecting my car and I'm disappointed in Tesla. If there were a different long-range electric vehicle with a nationwide charging network that also looks cool I would move my money over there.  But, alas, there isn't so I will just wait since they should eventually get their act together.  So much for thinking they learned from Model X though.

7w64ms,dtynone,Fucked by Tesla again. FSD is a scam and will practically never be real FSD for years to come given how bad AP2 is and how many close calls I have with that crap. They promised current owners early access to Model 3 without saying it would only be for the 50K model. 
7w64ms,dtyf7gb,"Priced out of a market due to 3750 less of a discount from 35000/45000 vehicle is a bit of an over reaction. One should be glad to have a government and state providing assistance for renewable energy purchases on a premium product, whatever the discount may be. Also, the 35k price point is subsidized by the more expensive options so one should feel lucky to break into a premium market with the help of the higher priced models. A company isn't going to produce a bad selling car just for your benefit, so there should be no reason to feel heartburn over the financial necessity to adjust the timing and planning of the higher margin options. 

There has been little to no bad faith. Ppl are over entitled to demand free stuff when they don't get their instant gratification. "
7w64ms,dty55pg,"I can't give you legal advice, but (generally speaking) this is a much tougher case for the seller.  The ""expected December 2016"" means little to me.  The key issue in my view is that telling a consumer that the product will be delivered with specific features that are not actually on the product at time of delivery.  That being said, I think the time to make a stink was at time of delivery or shortly thereafter.  The user manual issue is a legitimate point for sure."
7w64ms,dtydrvt,"> At the time I paid for EAP, the marketing materials said ""expected December 2016.""

7w64ms,dty4ick,"It‚Äôs not bad faith because Tesla didn‚Äôt plan not to deliver those features, and they had every reason to believe they could. It was their supplier who screwed them (and you)."
7w64ms,dtxry8k,"I totally understand the disappointment, particularly those who were banking on this being a $27,500 car or getting it when an existing lease was up.  Most people aren't throwing around threats, but it happens enough that I thought some perspective might be useful."
7w64ms,dtxtatw,"People also love to throw ""bait and switch"" around, especially when it comes to big purchases."

7w64ms,dtzaph6,"> Except you don't know where in the line, or even what line. And the line gets reshuffled underneath you opaquely without notice.

Yup, with the announcement of ""priotization of higher margin products"", it is entirely possible that somebody could go to a Tesla store tomorrow and order an AWD version and get it sooner than somebody who did a reservation on opening day for the 35k version."

7w64ms,dtzdgbp,"It all depends on whether the creator has violated the promises made.  I'm pretty sure that when you back a Kickstarter you have to click something that says ""this is not an order, you are backing a project with no guarantee of success or delivery.""  That pretty much negates the rights you would have if you were just placing a straightforward order."
7w64ms,dtxxps9,"Did Valve get sued because Half-Life 3 isn't out?  No, because there was no legally enforceable promise.  Same with Tesla.  LOTS of companies say things that turn out to be untrue.  Those that say things *that they know to be false at the time* are the ones who pay for it."

7w64ms,dtye1yp,"He's just another billionaire libertarian prick, he just has a good PR firm "
7w64ms,dtxwgqb,Agreed - that emotional investment drives the behavior.  I'm hoping we can try to channel the passion into fewer silly arguments.
7w64ms,dtxujo7,"What is deserving of the slavish devotion to company or individual that has failed to deliver? You have seen the car at this point, is it so special that you are afraid of missing your place in line for it? If they hit the magical number of cars made per year they say they will, you should be able to get one relatively quickly."
7w64ms,dtxwzyr,"My only answer on the invisible SR model is that they don't have anything they want you to see.  The car looks the same, the differences are under the floor.  Why give up the margin on the LR by teasing the SR?  I think this isn't fun, but it makes business sense."
7w64ms,dtzu1bn,"You are correct, sir, I apologize.  He didn't go to eight years of evil admiral school to be just Moff Tarkin."
7w64ms,dty1h3s,"You can believe it, but it's ridiculous.  If production ramp went according to plan, we'd have a 35k car by now."
7w64ms,dtzdqgv,"This is *exactly* what I am talking about.  In no world is it ""bad faith"" to push off the SR car.  Tesla has an *obligation* to its shareholders to maximize value.  Prioritizing deliveries of LR over SR is smart business.  Does that come at a cost in customer satisfaction for some?  Sure.  But that isn't bad faith.  That's capitalism.  Don't hate the player; hate the game."
7w64ms,dtxxh8y,"My comment about the benefit of the doubt means that public actors are not liable for any potential bad faith unless it can be proven by a preponderance of the evidence.  I don't see any evidence of any knowing misrepresentations, hence Tesla enjoys the benefit of a presumption of innocence (to borrow a term from criminal law).
  
I'm not sure what you mean by ""intentionally honest act.""  Do I think that Tesla believed that they could satisfy reservations in that window of time, assuming that the ramp moved as fast as they hoped?  Yes, I think so.  We don't have any evidence to the contrary.  Was that way too optimistic?  Yeah, sure looks like it.  Being optimistic and being wrong does not equal intentional deception.

Your question about ""stringing people along"" is so loaded that I hesitate to touch it.  All I'll say is that Tesla really doesn't need the $1000 loan, and makes it easy to get the money back.  If anyone feels strung along they should just get their money and go buy another car.
  
Finally, yes, I would prefer people stop claiming ""bad faith,"" ""bait and switch,"" etc.  It isn't helpful to the discussion, and is totally off base from a legal perspective.  You are, I guess, entitled to have an option that there has been ""bad faith,"" but in the sense that those words have legal meaning that opinion is no more grounded in fact than my opinion that I am the King of England and can demand my rightful throne.  I'm not trying to censor people's frustration - which I share - I just want people to understand what they're talking about."
7w64ms,dtzdiok,"I'm surprised by this reaction.  If you didn't read the thing you acknowledged at the time, that isn't Tesla's fault.  If you had said in 2016, ""no way, Tesla, I want to put down an ORDER and not this wishy-washy reservation crap"" then Tesla would have politely escorted you out of the showroom.  Tesla would be crazy to do anything other than this given all the uncertainties and the massive amount of work they had to (and still do) have to do."

7w64ms,dtyc1px,"Well, I have been making a stink with Tesla since just a few weeks after delivery and continuously since, and in fact have made formal complaints against them and filed a lemon law claim. They denied all claims in the beginning but have recently begun discussions with me.

My point here was that Tesla does sometimes act quite badly, and while delaying selling a Model 3 to someone that has a $1,000 refundable deposit in is probably not illegal or even unethical, they have stepped over that line in other places."
7w64ms,dtyehaf,"In the middle of January, 2017, they changed it to:

2) Know the difference between cars, trucks, and motorcycles

On top of that, the last time they added a feature to AP2 was in June, 2017, and they still haven't released rain sensing wipers (they are in beta, you don't call a feature ""beta"" when it's released). It's been 486 days since they **shipped** the first AP2 car."
7w64ms,dtywm44,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot#Hardware_2

Autopilot 2 (note I didn't say AP2 as tesla doesn't capitalize the P in Autopilot), has superior hardware in many ways but the software has had less time to mature.

Some argue that Autopilot 1 is better in some scenarios than Autopilot 2 and some argue vice versa.

Autopilot 1 in the old days was a $1500 feature, Autopilot 2 now is a $5000 feature.

The big issue for people like beastpilot is they paid or are still paying on a 6 figure car that is depreciating rapidly and they still haven't received anything that feels like a multi thousand dollar upgrade in capability. Between depreciation on the first car, depreciation the second car, and the Enhance Autopilot price increase they could be out tens of thousands of dollars on what was billed as an upgrade that would put Autopilot 1 in the rear view mirror but has instead been keeping neck and neck instead of leapfrogging as expected.

I'm sure Autopilot 2 will continue to improve and pull away from Autopilot 1 (likely to be a clear difference in 2018 favoring Autopilot 2) but the pace has been dreadfully slow and if you paid to not use a feature it'd wear on your nerves."

Additionally, Mobileye claims they discontinued with Tesla because Tesla was using their data beyond the level of safety it was meant for, so Tesla has some involvement in the breakup too.

I do really wonder how Tesla ""believed"" they could deliver all AP1 features in 2016 as late as December 22nd, yet now a year later we still aren't there. How do you believe you are 7 days away when you are actually 400+?"

If I say ""This whole thing with telling people the car starts at $35,000, taking their $1000 under that pretense, and then continually punting on actually making those cars, feels very bait and switchey"" I'm not saying we have some kind of legal claim that it is one.

IMO it's perfectly reasonable to think Tesla isn't acting in good faith, doing right by us, etc, in this case even if they're *legally* covered. Perfectly legal things can be underhanded/sneaky/immoral/bad-pr/etc. You can feel lied to by someone and not think they broke something legally binding.

Why? Well let's just assume Tesla broke their vehicle sale contract with you by not giving you the car you agreed to. Ok you win. Except winning is only part of the battle. The next thing the law determines is what are your damages, and in this case, since you didn't refuse delivery and demand full payment returned at the first realization that they sent you a non- conforming car, the damages are whatever the fair market value difference of that car vs the car they were supposed to have given you.

As the comment below indicates, that doesn't sound like a very large monetary amount, certainly not one an attorney would take a case over.  Maybe there is potential for class action, but I'm betting the total number of people this affected is also probably not enough for an attorney to want to take that case.

It's not like you gave them cash and they hand it back to you.  You don't hand the keys back and they tear up your check.  This is a titled possession - title has been transferred.

They took everyone in that camping line that lined up in good faith for a ~$35,000 car with more than 215 miles with the unstated assumption that a line means something and pushed them back past months and months of people.

7w64ms,dtyz3oc,"> the difference in value between the brand new car and the value when I identified it was non-conforming

So, it would actually be the difference in the value of the car they delivered to you and the car they were supposed to have delivered to you. So the difference in value between an AP1 and an AP2 (assuming you paid the same for each).  You can probably use the numbers from it being a brand new car in both circumstances. If you paid a different amount for the AP2 than you would have paid for the AP1, then it might get a little more complicated (but only a small, likely inconsequential matter of some adjustment of the monetary difference), but taxes should not be relevant, it would be the same tax structure in either case.

As far as treble damages, those try and incentivize a company to not do shady things that they know are too small for attorneys to deal with by multiplying the damages. However, I think even assuming you could get it to fall under that consumer protection breach of warranty scheme, its still going to be a small amount of money, not $20,000.

The other problem in this specific case is that it isn't clear that AP1 is superior to AP2, in fact many believe it is the other way around.  This would be a mess to prove, and the burden is on you of course to prove it is inferior and worth less, by a large clear margin.

7w64ms,dtz0d98,"I appreciate the education on the definition of damages in a case like this. In WA, where taxes are over 10%, I think you immediately have damages of over $10,000 on a $100K car, since there is no way to get the taxes back, and damages for warranties do seem to allow reasonable incidental charges. Even if the vehicle is worth exactly what I paid for it on the open market, that amount doesn't include the tax paid so there's no way for me to undo the transaction without incurring that tax.

Beyond that, I actually think there is a unique remedy available because this is a car, and Washington has a ""lemon law.""

Tesla created an express warranty under the UCC (and WA's warranty law) by showing me a sample (test drive), and a description (user manual and marketing materials). 

Washington's lemon law says:
>If the manufacturer, its agent, or the new motor vehicle dealer is unable to conform the new motor vehicle to the warranty by repairing or correcting any nonconformity after a reasonable number of attempts, the manufacturer, within forty calendar days of a consumer's written request to the manufacturer's corporate, dispute resolution, zone, or regional office address shall, at the option of the consumer, replace or repurchase the new motor vehicle.

I asked Tesla multiple times to get my car rain sensing wipers and autopilot like the manual described, and the failed to do so over 6+ attempts. This started back within a month of getting the car, and repeated every few weeks.

It appears that the law has a specific remedy to this situation, which is the repurchase of the vehicle, under a specific schedule for depreciation. So I don't really need to prove damages. While Tesla has denied my request for a buyback, luckily Washington has a binding arbitration board you can use for these disputes so you don't have to get a lawyer, which is what I am in the middle of doing. We're a year into it because Tesla asked me for months and months to just wait another month, and then has been slow to work with me, so the delay of having the car a year later is squarely on them.

Anyway, I know that is a somewhat unique way to deal with it, so it will be interesting to see what the attorney general says (they run the arbitration board in WA)."

A prosecutor (which is an agent of the government, of course, and required to uphold the legal protections for the accused - look at the *Brady* line of cases re exculpatory evidence if you want perhaps the best example) can't lock up the accused and throw away the key.  They have to make their case to a finder of fact.  Can the prosecutor argue to the jury that the accused is guilty and everything he/she says is a filthy lie?  Of course, but the judge will instruct that jury that the accused is legally entitled to the benefit of the doubt.  Is the accused a scumbag?  Maybe, but the law grants the accused a certain legal threshold.  Consumer fraud law grants Tesla a similar (but lesser) legal threshold.

1cdy71l,l1f60cq,What automatic speed setting are you on?
1cdy71l,l1i5muz,"The problem is that everyone drives differently.

This is one of the key things I've seen with the FSD posts, and that have amused me the most.  You've got some folks who drive cautiously complaining that it's too aggressive, and folks who drive aggressively who complain about it being too slow.

I'm an aggressive driver who believes that FSD has calmed me down.  I drive on average, and have an average experience with it.  It's slow in some places, and fast in other places, but *as a whole* it's not that far off the mark from how I drive.

*That said*, it's one of the reasons why I **highly** recommend not talking text posts about FSD performance too seriously.  While I believe there to be kernels of truth in those written experience posts, if the author isn't taking the time to provide visual aids, then honestly, I'm not sure how much weight I'd put in them.

Even me, [you can see some of my prior FSD Beta write ups](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/search?q=author%3Anakatomi2010+write+up&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on), and I've since stopped doing write ups and pivoted to videos.  No idea why 115 people have subscribed to my YouTube, but the videos serve only for me to be able to reference specific behaviors and such when discussing things with people online.

That said, at this point, unless the FSD experience write up is supplemented with a mounted camera video, I wouldn't take write ups at face value anymore.  We get a low of inflow from other subreddits where people just astroturf negative stories to screw with us.

Don't get me wrong, FSD isn't perfect, and [even I have issues with it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzvB1TVMvQw&t=1935s), but I think if people posted videos, and let others review them, the context of the complaint would shift more into the poster realizing that they might be being too critical."
1cdy71l,l1iba36,"I agree with you.  This latest FSD release is significantly better in many ways.  I have a number of issues with it still, but won't post without video for the reasons you outline.  I need to get a camera mount for that purpose.  Any suggestions?"
1cdy71l,l1id17r,"LOL!

[This is literally my camera mount](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F9duCKDW8AEapIj?format=jpg&name=large).  It's a cupholder mount for a cellphone, inserted into a cup, with a folded up paper towel to secure it in place.  Then I use another folded paper towel to secure the cup in the cup holder.

I think most people use s suction cup thing for the roof glass, but I did not want to deal with suction cup rings.

I have about 84,000 miles on my Y and I have turned auto lane change on a handful of times and every time it's been so bad i pull over and disable it. The longest I made it was about 50 miles once, pure terror. With auto lane change off autopilot is amazing; with it on it's near useless. 

With FSD I am habitually turning off the NoA blue button every trip before enabling FSD. It's set to not be on at the beginning of each trip but it does it anyway. Even then it lane changes into the fast lane for no reason all the time on highways, less than with the blue button on. It also seems to take about 1/2 a mile to complete a lane change and tries to yeet it in front of cars coming up from behind in the passing lane too. I worry about v11.

1231uap,jdz6ex6,"I used to gameify it driving my old car. If I was in stop and go traffic I‚Äôd leave enough of a following distance that I didn‚Äôt need to use brakes at all, just take my foot off of the accelerator.

If I had to brake, I lose. If I could maintain a safe distance with just taking my foot off of the accelerator I win.

So much more relaxing to drive that way.

Also helped break traffic waves because I rarely came to a complete stop unless someone else cut in."
1231uap,jdvjcp3,"> by cutting people off,

If you're slowing down and taking your time accelerating, I will go around you. I do my best not to cut anyone off, though. That's rude.

If you abruptly slow down because someone cuts you off, you create an accordion effect in heavy traffic and that can cause fender benders behind you. It's amplified if it's uphill, because people can't seem to figure out how to drive uphill at a constant speed.

Now you assume everyone else's emotional and mental states as well.     

Yep.. YOU are the right person to tell everyone else the correct thing to do... glad you posted here.. so now we all know how to be safe around you.  

my point stands...  you think everyone should drive like shit until everyone drive perfect... and others aggressive driving is an excuse for you to drive shitty too...  you only prove me correct and validated how OTHERS see you as a driver.

In Atlanta, everyone does this. So the guy behind me is most likely going to smash into me or get road rage if I'm letting everyone in because I'm letting the car keep a follow distance that big.

1c14392,kz21wu3,"FSD does long distance planning using the GPS map path planned and short distance planning for as far as it can see.  It was not properly programmed with a good way to plan for a few miles ahead.  

People naturally know that they are turning left ahead and stay in the left lane or the same in the right lane for right turns.  The FSD just follows its standard driving method until it gets to one of the programmed distances from the next turn. These FSD GPS path checks for turns only seem to occur around a half mile before a turn on local streets and around 2 miles on highways.  

It has the same problem on double left or double right turn lanes. If your next turn after this one happens to be further away than a half a mile, it often picks the wrong turn lane and will just get into the shortest turn lane."
1c14392,kz2alr0,"Does the same to me, every day since I got the trial. It's a left turn with a left turn only lane to get to the road to my house. 0.3-.04 miles before the turn it merges into right lane. I even hit left turn signal to keep it in correct lane and it immediately turns right signal on again. Weird quirk..."
1c14392,kz1l4tp,"God, I thought it was just me‚Ä¶ mine does this repeatedly, and no I‚Äôm not camped in the left lane I‚Äôm letting FSD decide or put me in the slow lane if I‚Äôm not passing. It has no issues with right lane turns from a highway or in the city but there‚Äôs something about preparing for left or left turns in the new version. FSD consistently cuts all the way to the right just AS it nears a left turn: like a mere 20-40 yards ahead. Very un-human like, and the blinker and auto initiated turn being repeated canceled by me confuses everyone around me.

Scenario one: I‚Äôm in the city in heavy streetlight commuter stop and go traffic, two lanes going either direction. Car puts itself in the left lane lined up for an approaching left turn a few lights ahead. That turn is a major with two left lanes that break away from the others to turn left in their own lanes at the light so cars can stack up to turn. A few lights approaching it things going fine car is passing through other identically configured intersections and lining up until it gets to the second to last light and begins insistingly attempting to move right across traffic to the far right lane with less than 50 feet to go. Knowing this would be a fiasco in the making I press the blinker button to stop it, but won‚Äôt take no for an answer tries again, and again. People get all pissed at me and I have to take it out of FSD to get into one of the left turn lanes with 25 feet or so to go. 

Scenario two: I‚Äôm on the three lane highway with two major exits that back cars up for miles, but I‚Äôm going straight. Idiots wait to the last minute to cut over and exit doing all sorts of dick moves trying to squeeze into gaps at the last minute which backs up the traffic in both RH lanes for a half mile, but me I‚Äôm trying to stay left and get past it all - clear sailing at speed normally. Not FSD, it insists on changing lanes right at the worst moments trying to dump me right into that mess even while those two lanes are very clearly stop and go with games of chicken underway, meanwhile the left lane is wide open, and I‚Äôm not even turning right. I try to cancel the turn, it insists, I cancel again, it insists and starts the merge right I take it out of FSD to carry on my way. I give FSD a pass on this one but it sure is counter-intuitive and head scratching.

I‚Äôve tried Chill, Normal and Aggressive no difference every days this week same places."
1c14392,kz13fgy,FSD has been rather unpredictable for me. It‚Äôs not unusable but the same route sometimes it gets into the wrong lane and sometimes it stays in the correct lane.

1c14392,kz26cyq,"You can trigger a lane change on FSD by giving the blinker to the lane you want to be in.  If it‚Äôs safe, it will make the lane change.

So, if you want to be left, signal left and it will do it.  If you don‚Äôt want it to go right, signal left and it should cancel its lane change."
1c14392,kz35kad,"Lane selection issues are my biggest problem with FSD right now. Merges to the right when it's got upcoming needs to be in the left lane, goes left when there's no real need for it, doesn't do a good job of picking exit lanes...

Part of this appears to be navigational data issues, but some of it isn't.

Last night, FSD tried to make what appeared to be left turn from a dedicated right turn lane (when navigation *clearly* needed a right)... Sure, it's a *mildly* goofy intersection but it's not that goofy, certainly not from a right turn perspective.

Outside of lane selection problems, FSD has been damn near perfect for me."
1c14392,kz3fopu,I‚Äôve had it follow the line into a turning lane on a freeway at 80mph. Multiple times. Switching to the right lane worked until it did the same in the right lane.
1c14392,kz3hzja,Yes! I‚Äôve also seen on the freeway; everything is going great until just before the exit when it tries to merge left out of the exit lane. It has its wires crossed somewhere.
1c14392,kz3ue8n,"I feel like it does this to get around traffic before making the turn. But it's really risky.

1c14392,kz15ci4,I've had multiple recent experiences where it moves *out* of the right lane when there is a right turn up ahead.  So maybe it's just counter steering like a motorcycle

1c14392,kz7xobq,This is similar but not exactly my experience. It does seem to operate off GPS at distance from a left turn but at it gets close maybe 50 yards? It tries to merge right before a left turn. That distance while moving should be well within the planning range.
1c14392,kz16335,It‚Äôs in Chill mode. Minimal speed lane changes
1c14392,kz2j5om,With this newest update the lane change is so quick. As soon as the blinkers go on it merges without a second thought if it‚Äôs clear. If there‚Äôs a car in the right car and is hesitating I‚Äôll give that a shot
1c14392,kz2pk73,"Part of the problem I've experienced with using the blinker is 50% it ignores my lane change and stays in the lane it wants to be in.  Or it starts to swerve into the lane I chose but then suddenly veers back.  This is when there are no other cars around, it's not avoiding other traffic.  


When I try to override a lane change it gives you so little warning you have to do it the second the blinker clicks or you end up swerving.  It won't take the hint and will keep trying to change lanes until you turn it off. 

It's close to being good but its tendency to fight the driver can be dangerous."
1c14392,kz7xb9s,"The problem is more with FSD initiated lane changes. Once it starts trying and you cancel, it tries again in 5 seconds, you cancel and it tries again, and again."
1c14392,kz42alp,"This happens so freuqently it's not practical to use FSD on several freeways around where I live. It's literally every 30 seconds to a minute on streches. Coupled with the removal of cruise control, I just have FSD disabled since it's less of a constant pain in the ass. Even though cruise control phantom braking is worse than it has ever been as well."
1c14392,kz4sr1r,"strange though, if its in Chill mode it shouldnt change lanes for the purpose of passing cars."
1c14392,kz12l5k,"Yeah, but this happens regularly when approaching an 7 lane intersection (2 incoming traffic lanes, 2 left turn lanes, two straight through lanes and one right turn lane). I'll be in the left of the two straight through lanes, and about the time Nav is saying ""In 500 feet, turn left"", FSDb attempts to abruptly move into the rightmost lane (through the lane between), which would then require crossing two lanes to get to the left turn lanes."
1c14392,kz1crcu,"Hah, mine does the exact opposite. 

On 2-lane highways, it constantly tries to get in the passing lane to ""get out of the right-most lane"" or whatever it says its reason is. 

On 3-lane highways, it does the same thing and just likes to chill in the center lane.

It does this even if there is no one in front of me. I assume it mostly does it to keep clear of on-ramps, but goddamn is it annoying.

Still on v11 though."
1c14392,kz1kfhk,That isn‚Äôt the law everywhere though

1c14392,kz2ga45,Flasher stick? You mean the turn signal?

1c14392,kz1b7wk,FSD Beta v12.3.2.1

At minimum, FSD needs to get into the correct turning lane as soon as possible. It‚Äôs not coming close to doing this and I‚Äôm always disengaging.¬†

1c14392,kz21dpj,"Interesting. I wonder if that's the programming for Chill mode that it tends to keep to the right lane.

I have mine on Assetive without minimal lane changes checked, and I have the opposite problem. Mine wants to always stay in the left even if there's no reason to. On the highway, with no traffic in front of me to pass, it just randomly likes to jump in the passing lane and slow down traffic behind me. I have to flick the signal to force it to move right, then eventually, it just decides to go back in the passing lane. It's annoying, even if traffic there is going faster than me, it'll just camp the left lane anyway."
1c14392,kz81prn,"I forgot you were in chill mode. Yeah that's strange. I'm always in aggressive mode, which is probably why it did it."
1c14392,kz12wjf,Yea they need to fix that if it's doing that... FSD definitely isn't perfect...
1c14392,kz1618o,Yup. My exact scenario. I‚Äôm like wtf you‚Äôve been doing so well. There must be a reason Tesla implemented this.
1c14392,kz1q2fj,Exactly!
1c14392,kz1h85l,This is my experience. I pride myself on lane discipline so having no way to prevent my car from moving to the left lane for no reason is maddening. Minimal lane changes just means nothing apparently. I miss having to use the turn signal stalks to confirm lane changes so badly.¬†
1c14392,kz2sh1u,Lol yeah. It was too early to write in another language than my native language.
1c14392,kz15odh,Interesting. In my scenario there was no one behind me and it still merged.
1c14392,kz0u6hi,If you wanna go fast be in the left lane.
1c14392,kz189lq,"Nope.  In the main case I'm thinking of the right lane is a carpool lane, but carpool is enabled for navigation and it's wide open compared to the lane it's trying to get into, so there's no obvious excuse.

There is another case where it moves into the left lane, which is a left turn only lane, when I need to stay in the right lane to go straight.

1c14392,kz19jwu,"It will also do that especially on the more passive modes. You can disable this by turning on ‚Äúminimal lane changes for this trip‚Äù which will pop up as an option whenever you cancel a lane change. You can also turn that on in settings. Annoyingly you have to set it on every trip, though, so I usually end up not having it on."

1c14392,kz5jgr3,"That is way cool, merci!!!"
1c14392,kz3d21q,"Minimal lane changes is a separate setting. All modes will still do what you mentioned unless minimal lane changes is ticked for the trip. Minimal lane changes will only change lanes to follow route or if otherwise absolutely necessary (or obviously if you use your turn signals to tell it to change lanes). You have to tick it on every single time you drive, as it turns off after you park. 

The original person is right for the thing you‚Äôre bringing up, it follows the idea of keep right pass left and the modes just change how often it attempts to pass, but minimal lane changes is a separate setting.

1c14392,kz4phtr,"That could be it. Since the auto cancelation, I always do a half push, no need for a full push."
1bt61bp,kxkw2xe,"Yeah, it's hard to use when there are people behind you.  The stop sign behavior is not very natural and frankly embarrassing.  It stops too early usually and then pulls up to the line and then takes forever to go.  Honestly, if pushing on the accelerator works this isn't a terrible solution, though.  If FSD was on a more natural progression, leaving drivers in charge of when to go at stop signs or intersections makes a lot of sense at this point in FSD's development."
1bt61bp,kxk57ls,"It IS hesitant but I just look over the situation and do the acceleration as I choose, while still letting FSD do the steering. Seems to work pretty well that way."
1bt61bp,kxk0dn0,"You can tap the accelerator. The car drives cautiously, as it should."
1bt61bp,kxl4uu9,My wife was very self-conscious using it with people behind us this weekend. Ended up needing to stay on the accelerator pedal/reset the target speed every time we passed a speed limit sign to keep up with the regular flow of traffic in our area.

1bt61bp,kxllyjo,"Mine seems fine on the approach, but starting out again from a stop sign, as opposed to a light, it's a real scaredy-cat."
1bt61bp,kxmx955,I‚Äôll take hesitant over spontaneous any day
1bt61bp,kxngh5q,"With v12 the cars weren‚Äôt coming to a complete stop when going based off the millions of videos of other drivers because nobody completely stops. Since it‚Äôs against the law, stop signs are one of the only things manually coded in which makes sense why v12 is just as shit as v11 when it comes to stop signs lol"
1bt61bp,kxk3hob,"Is this a stoplight intersection or a stop sign? I‚Äôve found that it is really good at stoplights and starts going the instant it turns green.

It‚Äôs very cautious at stop signs, however. I wish it would either do rolling stops, or at least make the initial stop farther forward so it doesn‚Äôt have to stop and creep."
1bt61bp,kxkzdqx,"I feel the opposite. V12 is too aggressive now and wasn't at all before. I feel it looks silly when nobody is near me at a 4-way stop and it peels out. What is strange is that other times it decides to be really slow when it shouldn't be. Today I had to make an unprotected right turn on a red as a car was coming from the left towards my lane and fsd decides to pull into the lane super slow And I almost got rear ended because it didn't speed up fast enough when my car got into the lane. I had to put my foot.

It seems to have an inconsistent balance on when to be aggressive and when not to be and it doesn't weigh the situation."
1bt61bp,kxlap1p,"Oh it is hesitant and sometimes overly safe. It drives like it's trying to pass a driving test at 16 with a inspector in the car.   You can thank the NHTSA for the full stops at every stop sign.

It's better but I hate the fact that if one lane splits into two it flounders in the middle for a few seconds before it picks one. (and often the one it picks is the wrong one based on a upcoming turn).

Most people who complain that it's terrible must not be ""riders"" in cars much.  God I have two teenage sons that I sometimes ride with and the 12.3 version if actually better than both of them."
1bt61bp,kxlgwzq,"Post video of it being bad. It‚Äôs all hot takes like this one and no video proof. I‚Äôm using it daily right now in the free month and it‚Äôs fine for me. All videos showing off 12.3 show it acting normally at intersections. The only people that don‚Äôt show videos are the ones complaining. Just tap that little dashcam icon on the screen the next time it does something weird, upload it, and post it here."
1bt61bp,kxoos5h,It has big student driver energy on side streets!
1bt61bp,kxtqd5u,"It only will travel at or below speed limit now despite using speed roll button to change it above limit.
Any other users experience this after most recent update?"
1bt61bp,kxl5vnr,"I noticed this in 11.4.9 as well and hoped it would be fixed in v12. Every damn intersection, even if the light is green and the path is clear, the car slows down. It‚Äôs irritating and could get me rear ended"
1bt61bp,kxjwjli,"Honestly, let the car behind you get pissed off.

Odds are they're not driving properly.

I'd rather train the machine than please the other drivers on the road."
1bt61bp,kxk9p9a,File a complaint with the NHTSA telling them their forced changes to FSD to pause at each stop make the car less safe by not matching regular human behavior.
1bt61bp,kxnkp4j,"FSD is a good gimmick but definitely not buying it, especially for 12k. It‚Äôs more annoying than anything."
1bt61bp,kxkv8j2,I've also found it to be extremely jerky when accelerating and decelerating. It's quite jarring.
1bt61bp,kxnrvpj,"Why are people worried about other idiots on the road?  They want to go around, go. I had a guy go in the center lane and blast by 3 cars just to go to a red light that I reached 3 seconds later."
1bt61bp,kxll3ds,">It stops too early usually and then pulls up to the line and then takes forever to go

This is exactly the issue. I have taught human drivers that this is not a great way to drive because it causes confusion to other cars at the intersection: ""is this person stopping at the line? Are they rolling it? Did they think the stop line was back there? Is it my turn or theirs?""

Smoothly deaccelerating to the stop line is how it needs to work, not slow down prior to the line and crawl up to it."
1bt61bp,kxk8xn4,"Agreed. I lightly press the accelerator as I approach the stop sign until I get to the point I want to stop at, and as soon as I want to go, I press the accelerator again. The whole time I still let the car do the turning and everything and it works well."
1bt61bp,kxmmu0b,"I‚Äôve done this a few times, still makes me nervous that the car might think I‚Äôm committing to crossing the intersection instead of getting up a normal stopping point at a stop sign."
1bt61bp,kxlyjzr,I realized this was possible after a few drives. It's the only way fsd is remotely useful.
1bt61bp,kxm0vin,"Yeah, not prime enough for the Boston area where it‚Äôs 25 posted but no one drives at 25. Even at 30, ppl do closer to 35, or 40 for the assertive ppl. 

The odd and unacceptable thing is it going below the 25 on some roads."
1bt61bp,kxkm3ka,"on the right hand scroll wheel, once FSD is engaged, click it to the right (or left I believe) and it will show you options for driving assertively, etc."
1bt61bp,kxrw43x,"From my experience, assertive mode doesn't make any difference here. It's just how they do stop signs for now."
1bt61bp,kxp8azn,"I actually was thinking the same, that camera location is very problematic in many situations"
1bt61bp,kxnlmwl,"v11 came in too hot to stop signs and would barely go through the intersection when clear. v12 is opposite that, creeps to a stop then commits nicely through."
1bt61bp,kxlq3hl,"Yeah, in v12 it slows down to a crawl as it gets to a stop sign and then a sudden jolt as it brakes all the way down to 0. It's obnoxious."
1bt61bp,kxo5042,Seriously. Also FSD requires input both from the hands and feet. It‚Äôs supposed to be hesitant waiting for a nudge of the accelerator. It wants to know there is control both at the steering and the pedals. There is truly a learning curve with FSD and most ppl here call wheels tires so you tell me if their posts and comments should be taken seriously lol
1bt61bp,kxkt55p,"They‚Äôve improved so much with v12. The stop sign situation and extremely slow driving needs to be FIXED. Not improved but actually fixed. 100% chance you are annoying other drivers at minimum (angering many) with these issues.¬†

The speed thing should be easy to fix. The stop signs should be almost as easy. ¬†If it needs to come to a full stop‚Ä¶ stop a little after the line so it can see"
1bt61bp,kxma5bq,Hw3 I assume? Same here but mine has been overall much improved
1bt61bp,kxo4hl2,If you pay attention all the accounts posting negative responses are accounts that have zero posts on Tesla subs. Out of nowhere. Haha. I have FSD and it‚Äôs near flawless for me. So either people are lying straight up or there is such a duality of experience the likes of which no other product experiences.
1bt61bp,kxk02vt,"That's a bad take. Just like people over speeding are a hazard on the road, people going unnecessarily slow/unpredictable are a hazard to others."
1bt61bp,kxjyzd6,"Errr no, don't let the car behind you get pissed off. Hesitant driving is unpredictable driving and when you start slowing down 50ft before the stop sign like some sort of hypermiler, the guy behind you is going to go on alert that you don't know wtf you are doing, and the more aggressive types may attempt to do something stupid to not be near you."
1bt61bp,kxlg8wr,They‚Äôre gonna tell you the sign that says STOP means you should actually stop. It‚Äôs not unsafe to stop at a stop sign. Don‚Äôt be a child.
1bt61bp,kxkppt8,Nobody forced anyone to use FSD.
1bt61bp,kxos440,"Maybe the issue is the discrepancy between what is legally required vs what everyday humans actually do. Technically you‚Äôre supposed to come to a full stop before the line, which is what the car does before creeping up forward for better visibility."
1bt61bp,kxkwd1e,I think this is a fair compromise but I'd be more comfortable if this was the official way of doing this as sometimes I fear I might make the car do something crazy by putting my own inputs in.
1bt61bp,kxo5dmo,"True, but the brake pedal is right there and you are on high alert at that point so you should be fine."
1bt61bp,kxmpfnc,Gotta treat it like ADAS for the best experience.
1bt61bp,kxn5wmk,Just increase the percent over the speed limit it drives? My issue is that Chicago has posted speeds of 45-55 but everyone drives 75 in both zones. How the hell do I make it drive the safe speed of 70ish no matter the posted speed? Can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I guess.
1bt61bp,kxp8u1h,You would think they at least make the front fenders be the side looking cameras and the b pillar cameras looking to the rear
1bt61bp,kxkwthv,"Yeah, I think it used to do this but the NHTSA forced Tesla to change.  This is why self-driving is so hard, it's  tough to program natural driving and follow the traffic laws strictly at the same time."
1bt61bp,kxpq9vx,"I think it‚Äôs different driving styles, and maybe different locations having slightly different procedures for sign installation. Personally I really don‚Äôt like the stop at sign, creep forward, stop again then go for the turn. Where I live that will end up getting me rear ended eventually.  This is most likely due to the sign being further back from the intersection so the car can‚Äôt get good visibility‚Ä¶ The sign set back might have something to do with snow removal ( aka if the sign is to close they get knocked over )"
1bt61bp,kxk0qzh,"OP is talking about how it feels slow approaching an intersection.

As such, I was responding to *that*.

Obviously if it's slow all the time, you accelerate and all that, but it's a supervised system, if you don't like what it's doing, just take control.

Again, the only time I have this issue is when I'm approaching a T-intersection and there's no car parked at the head of it.

Even in those cases, I just hit the accelerator when I feel its waited enough.

I've not felt it slow to the point where someone would feel a need to pass me.

[People are going to drive like shit even when you're *over* the speed limit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf7vJslZaN0&t=2618s)"
1bt61bp,kxlgndy,"You‚Äôre not supposed to accelerate until you get to the stop sign, then jam on your brakes. Slowing down before a stop is normal. You‚Äôre probably an extremely aggressive driver.

Show a video of it being unreasonably hesitant pulling up to a stop sign."
1bt61bp,kxn1fsm,"Slowing down 50ft from a stop sign isn't all that far away actually... considering a lot of vehicles take 130ft to come to a full stop from 60, 50ft from a stop sign is pretty reasonable at any speed between 30-50mph."
1bt61bp,kxjzb36,"People need to relax more on the road.

FSD's behavior at intersections and such is not *that* bad.

Worst I've had is long holds at T-intersections that don't have a car parked at the top of it."
1bt61bp,kxow1uh,"Exactly, the car is actually following the rules. I used to stop at the stop sign, wait 3 seconds, the move forward.

At least the car doesn‚Äôt wait 3 seconds, it just stops lol"
1bt61bp,kxpm8r7,"To be fair, there are as many styles of driving as there are drivers. I have habits, such as keeping to the second lane from the right most of the time, not shared by other drivers. The Tesla neural net coefficients will eventually converge on an average of participating drivers' habits (with certain rule-based overrides still governing).

I suspect I'll always be nudging the AI and acting like a ""driver's seat driver"" when it's in control until the day that the car starts learning from me personally. That capability and Tesla swarms are just over the next hill."
1bt61bp,kxoo6ns,"Of course, and while I am always on guard with FSD, I wouldn‚Äôt want to feel every intersection is a crapshoot that could injure someone, or damage my vehicle or some else‚Äôs vehicle. 

I think the team needs to work on improving stops to feel more natural. 

As of right now my takeaway with FSD so far is on side streets it drives with student driver energy. 

I would 100% regularly utilize the EAP features on the highway but FSD on the side streets does not have a natural feel yet. 

When FSD manages a stop sign with the same confidence it does a traffic light it will be ready for daily use."
1bt61bp,kxk1uvo,"Fair enough. It also acts weird at the stop signs. When i tried the FSD 12 yesterday the car would stop twice at the stop signs, once 25 to 30 feet before the white line of the stop sign and then again at the white line. That's not something humans do, and not people around you expect to do. It creates unnecessary danger to the driver and the others."
1bt61bp,kxn2wfc,"It's not necessarily when it starts to slow, it's more how it slows down. It initially slows, but then creeps up to the line, then stops. It is that creeping bit that signals confusion to other drivers at the intersection what you plan to do. If it smoothly decelerated to a complete stop in a parabolic curve it would be much more natural and I'd be ok with it."
1bt61bp,kxr1s6b,"If the  NHTSA had sensible stop sign rules there wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. Also, if local jurisdictions placed stop signs and stop lines sensibly it would be a huge improvement."
1bt61bp,kxk2k53,"Do you have a link to the intersection?

I've seen some where it'll stop at the sign, then scoot forward to the line, and I suspect that's mostly the NHTSA's fault."
1bt61bp,kxnahkr,"My response was to what you specifically said in your previous comment. What you're now describing is totally different. I do agree 100% that it needs to be a parabolic stop, but 50ft is not an unreasonable distance by any means."
1bt61bp,kxr2vci,Stop lines are definitely not the problem as FSD stops a lot further from the stop line.
1bt61bp,kxk38gd,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/85+Hawkins+Ave,+Parsippany,+NJ+07054/@40.8641039,-74.3879637,17z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x89c307ec293930df:0xd9daf60f6ed82a51!8m2!3d40.8640694!4d-74.3877722!16s%2Fg%2F11crw9k_0s

It happened at multiple stop signs, but this is the one remember for sure"
1bt61bp,kxnblb1,"50ft was a random spitball to make a point, but yes I could see how that comes off literally. No clue where it actually starts its weird slowdown as I did not measure it."
1bt61bp,kxrf32q,"I think there are big problems with stop lines. First, they are optional. Local jurisdictions don‚Äôt have to place them. Second, if they are placed, the stop sign is to be placed where the stop line is. Notice that the stop line, if it exists, dictates stop sign placement, not the other way around. 
If there is a crosswalk, the stop sign should be placed four feet before it. If there is neither stop line nor crosswalk the stop sign must be within fifty feet of the intersection. Closer being better.

So, it all gets mixed up. The sign is the most permanent feature and thus hardest to move but it doesn‚Äôt dictate the placement of the less permanent features. The guys with the paint can put lines anywhere the local powers that be say to put them. The sign of course seldom actually gets moved to match new lines if they aren‚Äôt placed next to the sign.
 
So, where are you supposed to actually stop? Behind the stop line or the crosswalk or if there is neither, before the intersection but in a position to see potential oncoming traffic. Interestingly, you usually are not required to stop at the sign unless that is beside the line.

Oh, and by the way, you are supposed to start slowing down 150 meters before the sign.

People, of course hardly ever do all this, but they have to be caught not doing what they should. No one can read their minds. But, code can be read so FSD has had to  follow the rules. Now though, FSD is going to a neural net stack and may become incomprehensible to any observer. Essentially, FSD‚Äôs mind may become as unreadable as a humans. Maybe it can slowly become better at dealing with stop signs, just as people do."
1bt61bp,kxk47sb,"Weird.

I'd expect it to stop at the sign, the creep forward to the curbing, then go.

Maybe try recalibrating the cameras."
1bt61bp,kxov9na,"It probably is starting where the highway guidebook mentions where you ""should"" start slowing down. Big problem here would be FSD HAS to obey those rules but those rules were written in a time where drum brakes were considered cutting edge tech ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
12btj82,jeyvkd5,Just make the minimize lane changes option a checkbox that I don't have to set each trip.
12btj82,jeyh8wo,"Not sure why but refresh s/x scroll wheel is still useless. I had figured if they were going to make a change here that they would also do it for the s/x. 

Either they don‚Äôt have any engineers that driver s/x or the right scroll wheel left/right is just non functional."
12btj82,jf0h965,I preferred the follow ‚Äúcar length‚Äù distance options
12btj82,jf2uwsb,"I wouldn't know.  I'm among the 18% of FSD saps who still haven't gotten *any* V11 update, so far."
12btj82,jf017qc,üò≠
12btj82,jf2xs9x,"I, for one, love this update. Quickly being able to toggle between Chill, Average, Assertive, and Minimal Lane Changes is dead simple, and they each perform exactly as intended. If I'm in a rush, I'll choose Assertive. If I'm in no rush, Chill or Average. If I'd rather choose my own lane changes, but still want the car to follow the route, I'll choose Minimal Lane Changes."
12btj82,jf4orum,I love the new update. FSD works way better in my opinion. I can use it all the time now. Just wish you didn‚Äôt have to push the Minimal Lane Change on every trip.
12btj82,jf0ja0e,This 100%
12btj82,jeyp467,"Came to this thread hoping to see that the refresh S/X adopted this with the FSD 11 branch. Sad they didn't. I don't understand why they have a completely useless button action, when the same action does something logical on their other vehicles."
12btj82,jez792q,My guess is they‚Äôre afraid of accidental cancellations of FSD. I‚Äôve seen plenty struggle to click right or left in scroll wheels without accidentally clicking the wheel. In a 3 or Y that‚Äôs relatively harmless but in the S and X inadvertently canceling out of FSD is a potential safety issue.
12btj82,jeykcib,We have dedicated stalks for it is why. I prefer having one of the wheels control music and the other climate or whatever you want
12btj82,jezjh6w,Also came to this thread for the same reason.
12btj82,jeynvbs,"Refresh S/X don't have stalks. The right wheel is for AP, click it for engage/disable and scroll up/down for speed. Tilt left/right does nothing. The physical wheel can tilt left/right but the software does not do anything."
12btj82,jeyt4k4,Ah gotcha. Im still thinking refresh is 2016+
12btj82,jeyzd8i,"Yeah, I like calling them Palladium to remove all confusion.

""Refresh"" can be mixed up with the 2016 refresh (aka 2016.5 aka models2)

Raven is the 2019 update that has the same exterior design but new motors. People know this name, IDK why the codename didn't stick for this update.

You could call them 2021, but it has the same issue of 2016 where early model year 2021 (all built late 2020) are actually Ravens. 2021.5 is another alternative but no one uses that.

""Plaid"" is a trim and doesn't include the base/LR model which is usually relevant when talking about the Palladium vehicles."
1cgfbm3,l1vc6dj,"Different experiences in different locations, for sure. On our highways, version 12 really shines. In town, there are days when I have zero interventions."
1cgfbm3,l1vetk6,"You can always iniated a lane change with the turn signal if you prefer, altho my experience is mostly the opposite, if I don't have the driving profile on Chill/Minimal lane changes it'll try and pass too often for my taste, I'd rather it only do so when it's necessary or convenient, not trying to get into a lane that's 1-2 mph faster."
1cgfbm3,l1vbd0u,Are you in aggressive mode?
1cgfbm3,l1vftdo,"lol I‚Äôm the totally opposite, I wish it would not try to pass slower cars, I‚Äôm not an aggressive driver . I hope they‚Äôll make minimize lane change an overall setting instead of having to set it every time."
1cgfbm3,l1vbftu,"V12 is only working in town, Highway is still running on V11. Don't ask me why, but i expect once they do get it working everywhere you are likely to have a different attitude."
1cgfbm3,l1veep3,Mine passes people when they are going slower and it gets out of the way when I am going slower. Not sure where you live but it‚Äôs been fine for me and I‚Äôm probably more impatient than you are.
1cgfbm3,l1vjgzs,FSD12 is amazing. Tons of teslas here so maybe the data set is just good (LA)
1cgfbm3,l1vkv7e,"Get more familiar with the settings in the car.

In this case, the FSD profiles.

* Chill will try to keep a longer follow distance, and make fewer lane changes
* Average will keep a typical follow distance, and make a few lane changes
* Assertive will keep a tight follow distance and change lanes as it sees fit.

You can change between profiles while FSD is engaged by click left/right on the right scroll wheel.

I will typically change the profile based on traffic conditions, so in low traffic situations I'll keep the car on Assertive, in high traffic situation I'll put the car in Chill, and in meh traffic conditions, I'll put it in Average.

If you're keeping it in one profile 100% of the time, then I feel like you're not doing it properly.

Additionally, keep in mind that the highway stack of FSD is not *quite* the same code as the city streets stack, the highway one is a little older and hasn't been brought forward.

That said, the system does require supervision, and it may require you to disengage from time to time for stupid shit

It may be that the highway stack is stuck like this until April 2025, when they'll likely release v13, but I'm hoping they cut things over before the end of the year, and that we see improvements there."
1cgfbm3,l1vq7qy,It's not there to serve you. You are there to help it. Eventually it will be there to serve you.
1cgfbm3,l1vtyu4,"This is literally one of the hardest engineering problems ever attempted, with stakes of life or death. Chill. It‚Äôs getting there."
1cgfbm3,l1vctoi,"That hasn't been my experience with it this last month during the demo, I've been using it every I get including on the highway. I don't even have it on Assertive mode. I wonder why?"
1cgfbm3,l1virs8,"Something I have come to terms with, is that it doesn't drive like you. You have a self driving car, let it drive. Unless time is a factor, let it drive. Try to remember it is trying to be safe and drive with caution. But you can force it to drive faster and change lanes with accelerating or turning on the turn signal. I am just glad that it doesn't randomly dive into turn lanes for no reason and jam the brakes when a car passes in front of it a half mile down the road. It is getting better."
1cgfbm3,l1vmmj0,Assertive mode in 12.3 makes good decisions in your context in my experience. Note that the prime directive is correctly to not crash.
1cgfbm3,l1vt2cx,"I literally toggle off FSD and go back to TACC half the time I know I‚Äôm hitting the highway.  Recently it phantom braked on the highway so hard it could have caused an accident. Never again.

1cgfbm3,l1weg5u,"If your highways are not marked properly, it‚Äôs not reliable. I live in Hawaii and our roads are trash."
1cgfbm3,l1wliqn,the highway FSD has not been updated to version 12 for anyone yet. Even the latest build of FSD 12.3.6 still only has version 11 on highways. Just hold tight and it should be moved over soon.
1cgfbm3,l1vcfzj,"Right, and makes sense. I actually agree with the town driving aspect, it's really slick and not too buggy. As another commenter mentioned highway driving is still on V11 so hopefully an upcoming updates patches this up"
1cgfbm3,l1xehdr,"V12 isn‚Äôt used on highways, highways use v11.¬†"
1cgfbm3,l1vbmon,The assertive mode yeah
1cgfbm3,l1x9p6x,^ ^ ^ ^ This
1cgfbm3,l1vbwbr,That is good to know! Seeing how the new version just dropped I had assumed the highway driving was using the same model. Surely hope in sight then. Thanks!
1cgfbm3,l1vdnzf,What lol? This whole time I thought FSD sucked in town but everyone else was raving about it because they were using it on the highway
1cgfbm3,l1vjjvb,Do we have any evidence for that?
1cgfbm3,l1vqefu,I wish you could have assertive without the short follow distance because the short follow distance collects rocks in my window on the freeway
1cgfbm3,l1vvusz,"I'm not trying to make it seem like it should be perfect and ""just work"". But I live in the midwest and traffic is so minimal on the highway.. The times I'm referring to it was simply just me and the other car in front of me with no obstructions and in clear daylight. If there was more traffic and decisions it was trying to process I'd be much more understanding. For me, in my area, it's just not great on the highways."
1cgfbm3,l1vdkk0,"I wonder if the assertive mode is interfering with it somehow, like a bug or something. I'll try switching back to average and see if that helps"
1cgfbm3,l1vcyyt,"It‚Äôs nowhere near perfect though. Lots of annoying things left to solve. There are times when I‚Äôm really frustrated with it, and then times when I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwow that was so awesome‚Äù."
1cgfbm3,l1vbv5c,I have a different experience where assertive mode routinely changes lines every time there‚Äôs a car in front of it. It‚Äôs actually obnoxious.
1cgfbm3,l1veneb,"The last update made it amazing in town. It's still good on the highways, I think op is only using AP if it's not changing lanes to pass."
1cgfbm3,l1veg7j,"Well, now you know. You should watch some of the later releases of V12, it is still capable of doing some strange things, but it's getting really good in town."
1cgfbm3,l1vn9je,Evidence for what? That highway is running V11 or that once V12 is in use it will get better?
1cgfbm3,l1x0p72,"Agreed.

Though, personally, I wish I simply had more control over all functions of the car, but I get that they're likely trying to retain as much control as possible for training simplicity."
1cgfbm3,l1vc6y6,"The few times that it has changed lanes it also leaves me in the left lane, which in my state is pretty frowned upon and meant for quick passing to leave open for emergency services. Maybe I'll have to test different drive modes and see if there are different outcomes"

1cgfbm3,l1vidcr,"As a curiosity, maybe. I can‚Äôt go more than a few minutes before I have to disengage it for being silly."
1cgfbm3,l1vznkj,That highways use 11. I could only find anecdotal evidence from users speculating
1cgfbm3,l1vdkfx,"Yup, hate that. Should at least move over for approaching vehicles. Nobody likes a left lane sitter."
1cgfbm3,l1vete5,If a car is coming from behind it'll move right saying it's avoiding the passing lane.
1cgfbm3,l1vj458,Hit your blinker.  It should automatically change lanes then.
1cgfbm3,l1vnft8,You have to disengage FSD on the videos?
1cgfbm3,l22jzni,"You can physically see the code change happening...we'll not really but the graphics on screen vhange when getting on and off highway, plus the auto max speed goes away, vehicle behaves as it has for years, a lot of other minor things give the tell tell sign that it is still using the same old code."
1cgfbm3,l1vie0w,That is not the case for me. Gets in the left lane - sometimes for no reason at all - and stays there. I know I can manually initiate but why should I have to?
1cgfbm3,l1xch5e,"It will try, but many times people coming up from behind just pass on the right before it can get out of the way so I often prompt it with the turn signal."
1cgfbm3,l26xmga,It does about 1 out of 10 times for me.
1cgfbm3,l1vjouk,"Right, but if I'm purchasing FSD I'd expect to not need to bump to wheel every 30 seconds even though I'm looking straight ahead and that it would be able to make a simple lane change without even more intervention. I've used Honda and Hyundai lane keep assist features for years and most of the time this feels like a set back on the highway"
1cgfbm3,l1vjsbm,Very strange. I think you may be on to something in your other post. Take it out of aggressive?
1cgfbm3,l1vmvqg,"Eh?  It changes lanes if you ask it.  It does it by itself sometimes, but the level of aggression isn't to everyone liking.  I hear people complaining it changes lanes too much quite often.  I guess you're the opposite.

I used a Honda lane keep and it wouldn't even keep a lane on a mildly sharp curve....  It's also supposed to prompt you for attention every 30 seconds and if it doesn't, it's not going to pass regulator scrutiny in a modern car."
1cgfbm3,l1w5zw6,FSD through whatever city you live in or near. It‚Äôs just not a real comparison to say Honda or Hyundai is close to this tech. It‚Äôs not perfect but over exaggerating just throws your whole argument in the dumpster.

15iyum7,juwz522,"For ‚Äúprospective hosts‚Äù of Tesla Superchargers, the ask isn‚Äôt too steep: Tesla covers all costs, upfront and ongoing associated with installing supercharger stations, according to the documents obtained by TechCrunch. That covers maintenance, as well as power costs, with Tesla optionally offering to install a dedicated meter just for the charging station alone, from which the bill will go directly to Tesla itself. [article](https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/26/inside-teslas-supercharger-partner-program-the-costs-and-commitments-of-electrifying-road-transport/amp/)

As others have said, you are going to make your money from other stuff on the property. If you had a small store, lounge, and things travelers would need while waiting, that‚Äôs where the money would come from."
15iyum7,juwzni0,"Estimates of how much it costs to build a supercharger range from $60k to $350k per plug depending on the local labor market, whether sufficient power is already available at the site, etc. Government subsidies might reduce that cost further, but it's still going to be extremely expensive. Then consider that you'd be making only a few cents per kWh, so at most a few dollars per hour. There's a reason that e.g. Chargepoint is still not profitable, even though they both operate a charging network and sell chargers. For Tesla it's worth it because having an extensive charging network makes the cars more appealing."
15iyum7,juwtoiw,"By itself I doubt it. If I owned a store, and could get more traffic by having people buy stuff while charging I would say yes. I don‚Äôt know how much Tesla pay for rent when they install superchargers at specific locations"
15iyum7,juwut0q,Idk. Tesla did make it so their chargers can be set to make money. Specifically I‚Äôm referring to the destination chargers. I can‚Äôt imagine that with SC they don‚Äôt have programs to share the revenue with property owners. Probably worth investigating with Tesla directly.
15iyum7,juykkgf,"You make the money on what's next to a supercharger.

Just like gas stations don't make much if any money on gas.  They make it all selling you a $5 Soda."
15iyum7,juwxh8d,"Like with gas stations, you likely won't make much if any money selling electricity -- not enough to keep it open, anyway. Any profit would likely come from the 'convenience store' side of things. You'll have to do some math to see if such a place would be profitable in your area.

Could you afford to finance and install enough charging stalls to generate enough income inside the store?

Does Tesla even partner with businesses in this way? Or would you have to go 3rd party chargers (Electrify America or something similar)?"
15iyum7,juy7fxa,"As long as it's near a banana stand, there's always money in it"
15iyum7,juxjf4i,"Make sure to buy the advance lots so you can lease to tenants like fast food, convenience store, yada yada yada."
15iyum7,juxhn61,"I‚Äôd have a small convenience store (or just vending machines) with clean bathrooms, trash cans around, vacuum machines, car wash, free air pump, etc."
15iyum7,juxnqlw,Tesla collects so much data on their customers and their behavior they usually have a good idea where they want their chargers to go. There is a however a page on their website where you can vote where you think they should build a charger.
15iyum7,juy8cs0,"Are there any good vendors or companies that can be recommended for businesses, looking to install chargers as an amenity without having the businesses pay for the chargers or installation?"
15iyum7,juwsi8y,I don‚Äôt think so. It‚Äôs always to drive extra business to somewhere else.
15iyum7,juz96hm,"Absolutely! If NACS is truly an open standard then it‚Äôs a great business opportunity for aspiring entrepreneurs. Gas stations make money on the convenience store and not the gas unless they sell a premium product such ultra high octane, no ethanol etc‚Ä¶ The same would have to apply to EV charging. 

Charging takes longer than filling up gas. People are more likely to hop out of their cars and explore.  It‚Äôs a great opportunity to build a Wawa-like convenience store, a car wash, express detailing, or something like that. Even a mini-arcade for the kids, gaming controllers, or literally anything geared towards killing time. 

The major downside is that non-Tesla charging station‚Äôs probably won‚Äôt show up on Tesla‚Äôs navigation map in the car. But I‚Äôm sure there will be laws, at least in some states, challenging this. 

It‚Äôs going to be a exciting future over the next 20 years."
15iyum7,juxf0a3,It is about 60k plus $40k install for 1 charger in Canada. Your fees will be 3x hydro rates.
15iyum7,jv11fxs,There‚Äôs always money in a banana stand. Set that up with Tesl driving folks right to you!
15iyum7,jv38028,"No, but there's always money in the banana stand"
15iyum7,juxd6of,"I hate the super charging stations that are located at more upscale-ish hotels but they don‚Äôt open their rest areas to visiting chargers. So essentially they can advertise that they offer super charging for their hotel guests, at Tesla expenses, but if we don‚Äôt actually stay at their hotel, we don‚Äôt get to use the rest rooms."

15iyum7,juxy9mx,Something like a gas station ?
15iyum7,juzpy3q,"A carwash would make sense - but cant be used while charging (unless the detailers clean/dry the car after the wash while plugged in, which would be fantastic)"
15iyum7,juxkso4,Don‚Äôt talk to anyone. Just go straight to the restroom. They asked for this by placing the charger there.
15iyum7,juxgj8q,The Holiday Inn Express in Barstow does this. It‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve seen a code required to use the restroom at a hotel. The front desk wouldn‚Äôt even let me kids use it.
15iyum7,juxjbd1,"LA has a place like this. I didn‚Äôt know until i got there and didn‚Äôt have enough time to go somewhere else, but they basically charge you for valet to charge your car for you and they also drive some of the cars like psychos."
15iyum7,juxu1be,"This is basically both the superchargers inside Philadelphia Center City lol. One is locked behind a non-24/7 parking lot, and the other is in another time locked parking lot. The next closest one is in the suburbs 15-20 minutes away."
15iyum7,jv0j1m7,I use the restrooms.  If I ever get stopped I‚Äôll go Karen on their ass.
15iyum7,jv0mb7g,"They do. And in case you‚Äôre thinking about that case earlier this year where some property owner turned the superchargers off as Tesla weren‚Äôt paying rent, they were. It turned out his son had redirected and was stealing the money."

qnnlsy,hjhgz3b,"This. It‚Äôs not if, it‚Äôs not may, it WILL make mistakes, some more dangerous than others. Do not get complacent, and do not let your guard down. It is not as easy to predict as regular autopilot was. You could be driving down a perfectly strait road with perfect lane lines and it could all of a sudden dive across the center line for no reason whatsoever."
qnnlsy,hjhvsr1,"To add to this.  The point of the scoring system was to determine if you could be a *hyper*-attentive driver.

To get a 100 (or 99/98) you had to be on the lookout for cars cutting you off, anticipating scenarios where you might need to brake faster than you'd normally expect etc.

You had to pay attention to get a good score at all times while driving, with FSD Beta on, it's even more imperative.

You will find your stress level while on FSD is greatly increased, but you're part of contributing to software that will be transformative, keep that in mind."
qnnlsy,hjhpi8a,"Also beware that at times the car may drive, technically, safely but not react the same way a person would so it can confuse and irritate other drivers around you. Be ready to take control if there are other cars behind or around you during turns, stops and other maneuvers."
qnnlsy,hjhhhyd,"I can't underscore the validity of what you're saying enough. I drove with FSD beta today on a 12 mile flat stretch that was essentially a straightaway with almost no traffic. Did 70 per posted speed. Yet my car regularly slammed on the brakes for no reason at least a dozen times. Quick decelerate, then it immediately resumed set speed. No other cars, no bridges, no overpasses, no tumbleweeds, no ghosts. Clear sunny day with very low winds. Yet somehow it needed to slam on brakes. Not at all fun and very distressing."
qnnlsy,hjhr8h6,"I second , Third and Fourth this. At times it will the smoothest drive you can have with FSD and other times Grand Theft Auto. So please be very careful if we mess up and it ends up on the front page this will become a huge mess for Tesla.  Watch out during Turning, Turning after a stop sign, Merging on to on RAMP,  high traffic areas, short turn lanes, or turn lanes closer to the transition area. if an 80 yr old Grandma has trouble with a certain driving area so will FSD. Might not be a Proper analogy but just be careful it's technically in ALPHA."
qnnlsy,hjhkvv6,Agree. People need to be VERY careful and not be complacent. Always keep your hands on the wheel ready to intervene at any moment. I've taken to making sure my max speed is reasonable and lowering it a lot with the scroll wheel to quite slow when coming up to traffic control or turns when I do not know how it'll behave. It's a lot safer to correct at a low speed than at 45mph!
qnnlsy,hjht1vn,"Could not agree with all of his more. FSD Beta CAN make decisions that can kill you. Please, please, please have your hands on the steering wheel in a position (and with a level of grip) that will prevent it from making any directional changes that put you in grave danger. ALWAYS be vigilant"

qnnlsy,hjhs5nt,"Biggest no-no that it‚Äôs done for me is when I‚Äôm on a two lane road.  Double yellow lines separating the directions, and I‚Äôm waiting in line for a long light (pretty far back). The car will try to go around the line of traffic, over the double yellow.  Into oncoming traffic. Other than that, the csr makes it‚Äôs occasional mistake, but nothing terrible."
qnnlsy,hjhsw9w,Thank you to all of you taking time to properly beta test this thing. I certainly don't want to take the time to do so. Hopefully in a couple of years we can all enjoy a solid FSD experience in part due to all you beta testers taking one for the team.
qnnlsy,hji01f5,I have a 98. I expect to get it this weekend. But I‚Äôm afraid that all of the bugs and issues will be *too* much. Is it possible to just go back to autopilot like it is now? Or would I need to leave the beta? Is that even possible?
qnnlsy,hjhqdmc,My question is less about expectations of FSD Beta and more looking for someone to share going from radar to vision and since FSD Beta removes radar.
qnnlsy,hji63up,"\+1

Having said all that, do enjoy the progress of this awesome tech. Pay attention to how much the car can see around it. It's truly incredible! The cars it sees, the streets, the people, etc. How it builds a visualization of the area you're driving in realtime is truly impressive. The progress made on the vision side is something to see. The drive planner, the code that drives the car on the results of that visualization is evolving. It's the other half of the challenge to make FSD work and it's certainly very much work in progress. 

Be cautious. Enjoy that you're experiencing tech that people will later take for granted in the future. We get to be part of that journey, it's what some of us early adopters live for after all ;) and even pay for..."

qnnlsy,hjjvf0u,"The progress they have made is impressive, but it has a very long way to go."
qnnlsy,hjm6d3v,"Fuck the safety score, I give up. Wasted $10k. 
I have reset my score twice and get even a 99 here in shithole Florida

Drove 80 miles, got a bogus FCW that I was going like 20mph and was like 7 car lengths behind the car and boom got a warning that destroyed my score So I reset it again

and today I decided Ill just do it in one go and drove 100 miles on the highway with autopilot. On my way back I saw there was an accident and got off autopilot to be safe and a car cut me off and slammed on their brakes and that was after an hour of driving and 95 miles later. 

I'm just so over this shit, and tired how FCWs hit the score so hard and most warning are so dumb and make no sense

I'm sorry for the rant, but I had to get it out."
qnnlsy,hjnnd0e,Did anybody with a 98 get it yet? Nothing here yet.
qnnlsy,hjhuxaf,"I drove at night, and in the rain, with FSD Beta tonight.  And an intervention where it tried to go in to oncoming traffic at one intersection, and later on I had to intervene because it tried to go straight in to a curb that was a left turn curb.

Also had to intervene because it didn't see a slight right that it normally handles just fine on the way home.

Honestly I felt it ha died driving at night better than during the day. 

Some spots I feel it handled things better than me because of how the lights were reflecting off my windows and obfuscation my field of view at night. 

It is *very* impressive.  *When it works*."
qnnlsy,hjhk476,"Yes, and I left out that when I was returning home, it could easily have killed me. I took the exit off the highway to take the road home. There's a stop sign when the exit ramp meets said road. I expected the car to stop at the sign. It did not. Before I had a chance to take control, it sped right through the stop sign without taking even a second to check whether traffic was coming down the road. It was a great scare and I have reported it by email."
qnnlsy,hjhpjwf,"Eh I'd say it's as predictable if you pay attention both the the environment *and* the visualization. It's just that now there's a lot more factors at play rather than just lines.  


Like for example, often the reason it will serve left a bit when there are no cars around is because it seems to be marking mailboxes as people."

qnnlsy,hji737j,1000% this I feel like FSD beta is almost going to  lead to a lot of rear ending from other drivers. I disengage a good amount as people around here tailgate and I don‚Äôt trust them not to hit my car when it randomly decides it‚Äôs time to slam on the breaks.
qnnlsy,hjimv26,"Yeah, I've been using it a lot less than I expected because it makes you look like an absolutely shitty driver to everyone around you. In most cases it works ok but in many cases it makes you look like a 10 year old that stole a car and doesn't know how to drive it. I also hate the fact that it often doesn't use turn signals until the very last moment. I didn't realize that ""BMW"" was one of the FSD driving profiles."

qnnlsy,hjiiddx,"Agreed.  

I've counted 10 times when I'm having a disengagement-free FSD drive where other drivers making really bad mistakes have caused me to disengage.

A good example: twice, I was making a left turn where two lanes could turn left.  The Tesla was doing fine, staying in the appropriate lane, when the car to my right that was in the outer left-turn lane, decided to move into my lane.  I had to disengage and brake as they cut me off.

Another time, I was making a left turn at a light (green arrow) and a driver coming the opposite direction decided to make a right on red not noticing me turning at all.

I could go on..."

qnnlsy,hjjsr12,"Out of curiosity, has your car ever actually made a right hand turn? Seems like it's working really hard to avoid doing it."
qnnlsy,hjjm969,"It isn't unethical.

It seems as though a number of people have been jumping in to this thinking it'd work pretty good, but the reality is that it has issues.  That's how a beta test works.

Yes, you're testing it on a big ol' vehicle that could kill the occupant, or people around you, but as the driver you need to be in command of the vehicle and be aware of any stupid shit that the vehicle might do.

It isn't really unethical, however, it is a bit of a back step for some folks who are used to their cars performing significantly better on autopilot than it currently does.

By joining the beta you agreed to help them test their software.  So pay attention, not hard.

I feel like most of the complaints I'm seeing about it are from folks who don't fully grasp the concept of a beta testing phase."
qnnlsy,hjjp62v,"Someone who claims to own two Teslas should know to always keep your hands on the wheel when AP is on.   Just like riding a bicycle or a motorcycle, hands on the wheel.

No one's making everyone turn on the Beta software.  We all make choices.  We all have responsibilities when we make those choices."
qnnlsy,hjrql9c,"Tesla didn't force me to join the program. if you don't like, you can just walk away.

qnnlsy,hjk3avy,"From what we've been told each use of either pedal is recorded as it when you take over by force on the wheel. (Pressing up on the stalk isn't)

I assume there are other passive ones, such as the environmental collection campaigns that have existing pre beta, and probably any times the NNs environmental understanding is very erratic.

But those first two are the ones we ""know"" about, and what I was mainly talking about. We don't however know how much/what is being collected, so if there's a major or rare error that's why I say snapshot."
qnnlsy,hji94kc,"So if this new version comes out tomorrow I should get it pushed to me after having the previous version for only 2 days?

qnnlsy,hjile5o,Looks like delayed ATM.  Just saw a report they found an issue in 10.4 and are working on a fix and plan to send to internal testers around 3am Saturday morning.   Then if no issues probably send to external beta vehicles Sunday.

qnnlsy,hjjlz8j,"According to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle

> In general, external availability of alpha software is uncommon in proprietary software

While you are right in that it isn't the definition of Alpha and Beta releases, for proprietary software it is uncommon for an Alpha to be released to the public.

> The alpha phase usually ends with a feature freeze, indicating that no more features will be added to the software. At this time, the software is said to be feature complete.

Basically FSD Beta is the feature complete suite of FSD, and now we're testing it until it is ready to market."
qnnlsy,hjjxvgi,"A right turn?  All the time.  

It's doing fine on complicated lefts turns too (like with two left hand turn lanes, needing to avoid a center lane island).

I have a couple of examples of bad right turns in my area though: 

* on one street it will take the right turn into a bike lane.  The bike lane isn't mapped at all.
* on another it takes the right not from the right-turn only lane, again, this right-turn only lane isn't mapped. 

Right on reds are hard though, I usually need to tap the accelerator."

qnnlsy,hjjmfj6,"Yeah, you'll see the newer release even if two days passed.

That being said, 10.4 got delayed a day.

Honestly at this point I'm just going to assume Sunday is the release day as I've never seen it get released on the Saturday morning, lol"

qnnlsy,hjk1yy5,"You can't really apply alpha / beta from traditional s/w dev to ML efforts like Teslas. It's clearly NOT feature complete, as it's not able to drive in snow for example. Or at all yet, if we're honest.

Tesla is using perpetual beta for all their software that doesn't yet work satisfactory (auto-wipers, auto high-beam, autopilot etc). FSD is more alpha than any of those. Pretty much everything that starts with auto + smart summon ;)"
qnnlsy,hjjm0lo,"**[Software release life cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle)** 
 
 >A software release life cycle is the sum of the stages of development and maturity for a piece of computer software. Cycles range from its initial development to its eventual release, and include updated versions of the released version to help improve software or fix software bugs still present in the software. Computer users are most likely to be familiar with the beta phase, as software products are sometimes publicly advertised as being beta in order to reduce users' expectations of their reliability.

qnnlsy,hjk3q8o,"Generally speaking ""Feature Complete"" means the capability is there and intended for final release, but needs refinement.

An Alpha might have features nit intended for release that they were messing with.

Beta is basically saying ""This is the product you're going to get once we refine it during the beta"""
qnnlsy,hjk5be2,"As Tesla hasn't stated scope, other than Level 2 autonomy (to the regulators), so if it's feature complete then, as per your definition, a Level 2 ADAS, if it's in beta...  
Again, Tesla has no track record of removing the beta label from a single feature afaik. It will be in beta by 2030 still and not be self-driving (using current hardware), is my guess.

Tesla is using ""beta"" as a marketing label to lower expectations, and there is no point trying to shoe horn it into a alpha/beta label if you ask me,"

1biqcqu,kvm6pn3,"The speed has been my biggest issue, it's usually 5mph too slow and will sometimes slow down further at weird moments.

I haven't experienced it being too tight into corners, turns have been excellent for me. I'm not sure exactly what you mean with the noisemakers, are you talking about making a left, and the car is cutting the corner of the oncoming lane and touching the yellow line?

The lane centering has been decent for me but it definitely doesn't feel quite as locked in its lane as v11 was but it hasn't been bad at all.

*""In stop and go traffic, it would not move all they way up to the car in front of me leaving a large space causing me to get cut off multiple times.""* To me this is actually good, the car should be leaving space and allowing cars to change lanes in stop and go traffic.

hcybcs,fvhz0k2,">CAMPING. On the subject of driving cross-country‚Ä¶ When The Oatmeal published his story, camping in Teslas hadn‚Äôt even really been discovered yet. One lady here in town peeked in the back of my car and gasped, ‚ÄúIt has more space than my Ford Explorer!‚Äù Yes, there is plenty of room to stretch out. It could charge from an RV hookup while I sleep in the back. That reminds me, I need to put in my order for a Dreamcase. 

Camping was a big part of electric car life for a lot of the first Tesla owners.  Campsites had electric car charging before there was a Supercharger network, so RV parks filld the gap.  I wasn't a long range driver but there were some vocal ones

I was one of the "" guys who are still waiting because they think there‚Äôs a refresh right around the corner"" but finally bought my second Tesla in 2018.  There have been a few changes but my 100D is still fundamentally the same car as a 2020.  Waiting for Tesla is a serious committment!"

1c1gufw,kz3a2pj,Is highland getting the 1 month free trial of FSD?
1c1gufw,kz30ep3,Just got mine too!
1c1gufw,kz36rua,My 2023 Perf still waiting :(
1c1gufw,kz35f3d,Welcome to the party
1c1gufw,kz4ivqs,Anyone know if it‚Äôs coming to EU for the highland?
1c1gufw,kz5fj4k,Got mine this morning! Said it was some minor improvements then I saw the email and restarted the app and had FSD in the highland! It‚Äôs fantastic:)
1c1gufw,kz6jmba,Has anyone on the 2024.8.* branch gotten FSD?
1c1gufw,kzalm7e,"With FSD when you get to the Fork on the Road, yup, Take it!"
1c1gufw,kzqxc48,Did you get smart summon?
1c1gufw,kzrf8kv,"I got sick of looking at my T app every day.  Pulled the trigger on $99 FSD for a month. The pissoff is that FSD is already onboard. No downloading, took one second to switch on."
1c1gufw,l1fypgl,"I really don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre going to give FSD to me. 2021 M3 and 2023 MY.  I went to Tesla who told me that they cannot do a forced upgrade. I broke down and bought it for $99 for 30 days on the Model 3 which has an Atom Intel processor. The MY has the Ryzen chip but wife doesn‚Äôt want to try FSD. 
LOVE the new Quicksilver color for the Y in Germany! I‚Äôm in Solvang and it can get hot here in Summer so I opted for the Pearl White on both cars. Others are too dark for heat. Maybe one day  Quicksilver will show up here. They had silver in 2016."
1c1gufw,kzh4nr3,I am wary of using it. I got the free trial on Wednesday but I don‚Äôt feel comfy using it.  It‚Äôs my first Tesla.
1c1gufw,kz8upqb,"Has anyone ever have the battery die and the replacement cost is 13,000!  my daughters car has 6000 miles on it and was not driven for 6 months and unbeknownst to my daughter the car battery dies and is unrepairable"
1c1gufw,kz3bl4i,"I just tried it out on our highland and it‚Äôs amazing! I‚Äôm in an urban area and it dealt with stop signs, traffic lights, and pedestrians pretty well. It even parallel parked for us when we got to our spot. I saw a lot of comments recently about how slow it was to park, but as soon as I initiated the park, it went immediately within a second. There was no delay at all for me."
1c1gufw,kz3a97h,"Yes, I got the email as soon as I finished updating. location: Canada"
1c1gufw,kz37cvx,Curious. Is your update setting set to advanced?
1c1gufw,kzrk2ec,23 M3P still waiting. You get yours?
1c1gufw,l48spgz,You will get it! Mine came May 9th! 2023 MY
1c1gufw,kz4z13y,Has it arrived for the other ones?
1c1gufw,kz78byn,Still waiting.
1c1gufw,kzf0v5j,Still awaiting
1c1gufw,kzrff3q,No only autopark
1c1gufw,kzrfdq4,You may have used a trial before
1c1gufw,l48tjvq,"Same w me!  I have a 2021 for $99 got 11.1 disappointing! Like you said no download there already,"
1c1gufw,l1fzgig,"To be honest you are not missing on much, had the free trial probably used 10 times in the last 20 days and have no plans on using it. Reasons:
1 - It is not safe, it has put me in very dangerous situations where an auto pilot does not. Disengaged when in left lane at 70mphs
2 - sometime goes very close to curbs and other cars in addition to accidentals going in must turn right lanes
3 - which is the most key: I bought a tesla to enjoy driving which I think this is a great car to drive otherwise I would have called a green Uber if I wanted to be driven somewhere

I think when cybercab fleet thing ever comes out I may send my car to generate some cash - at least cover its insurance and some basic costs"
1c1gufw,kzrfwhz,"I have been using FSD for over 300 miles without any issue however yesterday driving on the left lane at 70mph due to my stupidity it got disengaged because I was trying to add a stop on the nav screen. The car behind me almost rearended me

I believe that going at so high speeds it should at least revert back to cruise control mode otherwise it is very dangerous"
1c1gufw,lbhulye,"I felt very apprehensive when I first engaged FSD as did my passenger whose a little nervous having been in a bad accident as a child. FSD was so good that within 5 minutes, we were both relaxed as it drove!"
1c1gufw,kzbx92e,The car has 6000 miles on it? The battery is dead and will cost $13k to replace? ü§î This post is either made up or there is much more to it than you are letting on.
1c1gufw,kz3ll3j,Ditto! Much less sporadic than version 11 was on my 2021.
1c1gufw,kz8r0cb,Mine was great in suburbs. Terrible in City. Phantom breaking under every bridge
1c1gufw,kzipioy,does it also detects roundabouts?
1c1gufw,kz3apmx,"Awesome, I‚Äôm getting the highland on Monday. Hopefully I get the FSD trial soon after"
1c1gufw,kz56u91,When does it expire for you? 30 days from today?
1c1gufw,kz393f4,Yep
1c1gufw,kz37tnw,Why would this matter? Should it not be on advanced?
1c1gufw,kzteb8t,Nope
1c1gufw,kzrg5lu,Negative
1c1gufw,l48sbtt,I finally received FSD 9 May! 12.6.3 Elon waited for latest version. I paid for it in my 3 and got 11.1 which was not worth it
1c1gufw,l1g5k6a,"That‚Äôs a good point.  I noticed that I didn‚Äôt get the 12.3 FSD.  Maybe it‚Äôs due to the fact that I have the smaller cameras and cannot 
use the software up to its true best as in a 2024 Model. I‚Äôm like you, they‚Äôre a kick to drive and I enjoy doing it. The better it
gets, the more people will try to trick it with more dire consequences."
1c1gufw,kzkokvk,"Lithium battery‚Äôs don‚Äôt react well to staying in a single state of charge for 6 months, and if it wasn‚Äôt on a charger that‚Äôs even worse"
1c1gufw,kz9l1a0,"On our way back, there was two instances of phantom braking, 1 time involving it seeing a pedestrian crossing when I was supposed to take a left, and a second time when there was a left turn, with an immediate fork in the road where I had to yield right. 

I guess my earlier FSD comment was regarding on strictly on the way there as I had only experienced that trip at the time of comment. It was seamless."
1c1gufw,kza4118,"yeah just got mine and did a small drive. it was fine but very impressed how a piece of this tech exists. 

my only issue living in california is how slow the car drives.. because it‚Äôs following the law üòÇ"
1c1gufw,kzkvyy2,Detects and handles them very well.
1c1gufw,lbht447,"I have a roundabout on my commute. FSD came into the roundabout a little hot, then proceeded to take the turn better than I could. It seemed like it ‚Äúlearned‚Äù about it as it improved each time I went through it."
1c1gufw,kza4482,"i got my last weds, and got the trial last night. so should be soon"
1c1gufw,kz8ly89,"Yes, 30 days from the moment you update"
1c1gufw,kz39alj,I responded to someone else but toggle it to standard and back to Advanced and reboot
1c1gufw,kz381zs,"I was just gonna recommend if it was not set to Advanced, to set it as such and reboot his car

As most have seen this update like all others rolls out in waves and it‚Äôs just luck of the draw on who will get it when it seems"
1c1gufw,l1ygrec,Thinking we got skipped. Did you ever get a trial?
1c1gufw,kzrga0x,"That‚Äôs interesting, where are you located"
1c1gufw,kzrgjp4,I even asked a Tesla tech when he rotated tires. They can‚Äôt force a download. Done by VIN number. Central CA
1c1gufw,kz3bmnt,Will give it a try! Never rebooted it before lol
1c1gufw,kz6jfil,Two roller ball reboot or something else?
1c1gufw,l1ygyia,"I had one when I first bought the car via a referral bonus, but still nothing on this round."
1c1gufw,l48t512,"I went to Tesla over it. They can‚Äôt force a download, all done by VIN NUMBER. I got 12.6.3 last weekend"
1c1gufw,l48t90m,I also just finally got the trial last weekend
1bv4hkq,kxx0my5,"I just drove to Connecticut from texas.  5000 mile round trip, no regrets taking the tesla."
1bv4hkq,kxx99jq,Yes that‚Äôs why you bought the car.
1bv4hkq,kxxc4cz,"11% is a huge buffer,  take your trip and enjoy your car"
1bv4hkq,kxx1ybn,Yes
1bv4hkq,kxx6d9n,"Traffic is not very much of a concern according to my experience of using Tesla on a long road trip. But stopping at the rest area or anywhere and then resume the trip seems to consume more energy than getting stuck in the traffic based on my own experience. 

I think you should be good driving all the way to XL center. As long as the car does not project to be less than 5% before you have reached your final destination, you should have enough."
1bv4hkq,kxx2wmj,I do 300 miles trips without issues.  I was going to do 600 miles but stopped not because of Tesla but rather due to that being too long a drive. Note I would only worry if no superchargers on the way or where you are going
1bv4hkq,kxx4rbx,"As along you aren't absolutely hammering on the power and have no severe weather problems, you'll be fine. As a layer of precaution you might decide to take up to 5-10 minutes per each charger. Some chargers end up taking longer than expected too, so only base the extra time after you receive ""You have enough charge to continue on your trip.""

The computer will tell you reliably if you're burning through energy too quickly. There shouldn't be any worries for a smaller trip like this."
1bv4hkq,kxxiqx7,If you hit traffic it will probably increase your percentage at the next stop. You will just have to slow down if there is a strong head wind.
1bv4hkq,kxxxmo6,"Yes. Why not? You might have to put a closer supercharger in. It doesn‚Äôt take long to charge and it‚Äôs nice to have bathroom breaks. Usually by the time I use the bathroom and get snacks and what not, the car is charged."
1bv4hkq,kxykbdh,YOLO ü§òüèº
1bv4hkq,ky0mu1m,"I have never asked myself that question since buying car. That‚Äôs plenty of charge left. Ive often found I have more battery left than it stated I would. Maybe it‚Äôs because I drive fairly aggressive 75 miles round trip for work every (driving history) and when I go on long trips, I‚Äôm usually driving pretty laid back. I wouldn‚Äôt have bought the car if I couldn‚Äôt take it everywhere. On my first trip that I ever used a super charger, I was pushing it pretty hard and it got to 2% when I reached the mapped charger. I was one of those people that would drive my ICE car with the needle in the red quite often so I have no ‚Äúrange anxiety‚Äù. Go for it!"
1bv4hkq,kxx4vbt,Sure; but not over 70mph
1bv4hkq,kxx2oy9,"To clarify, I won't have time to stop on my way to XL Center and have to do these stops in this order."
1bv4hkq,kxxigtr,Yes
1bv4hkq,kxxknqv,"Hope there are other supercharges around, why do you need to let it go that low"
1bv4hkq,kxxks94,"I drove from Nashville to Portland, OR and back in November. The Tesla had no issues, even in the Rockies where it was snowing."
1bv4hkq,kxxt1j6,Not an issue; absolutely.  You‚Äôll love it. Flip on FSD on assertive and coast.
1bv4hkq,kxxz6db,"After getting to a supercharger with 1% battery last weekend, I‚Äôd say go for it üòÖ"
1bv4hkq,kxy8fhw,Plenty of buffer with 11%. Might be a good idea to find a nearby Level 2 through the ChargePoint app or something similar as a backup.
1bv4hkq,kxy8x80,"Of course. I‚Äôve done southern Oregon to Utah, there‚Äôs a lot dead space. No fear at all."
1bv4hkq,kxygeby,Put it in autopilot and take the drive
1bv4hkq,kxyw2or,"The route planner only has you charging until you ‚Äúhave enough charge‚Äù to make it to the next planned stop. If you charge longer you‚Äôll be at a higher percentage for the next stop. I did a trip to Vegas last year and it wanted me to stop twice, I only needed to stop once though"
1bv4hkq,ky16itr,"I've taken two big trips in mine, the latest one was over 3000 miles from Florida to Kansas and back.  You can trust the estimate as long as you stay at the speed limit. It might vary a little up or down, but it will be fairly accurate.  For example, I had a long leg in Texas that had me arriving with 11% remaining, but I drove at 80 mph and got there with 9% left (in my defense, the speed limit there was 75)."
1bv4hkq,kyix1mv,Yep
1bv4hkq,kym56wl,"Trip was successful. When I left stop 1 for the XL Center, the computer actually predicted I'd have 30% remaining. Not sure why the initial prediction in the app was different. 

  
Great first experience. Super charging took longer than I expected as the battery was cold. Need to give the car more notice before heading to one."
1bv4hkq,kxyopsb,If you‚Äôre concerned keep it at 65 mph and slow roll it for low kWh consumption.
1bv4hkq,kxx8szh,I‚Äôd take the ICE to be safe.
1bv4hkq,kxx67un,Just got home from florida. 10 hr drive and a fresh fsd trial. Easiest drive from florida ever.
1bv4hkq,kxxytv3,Thanks.  I just finished a drive and was worried hovering around 14%-11%
1bv4hkq,kxxh58p,"I would start at 95% charge at least. And plug in near XL center if you can to add at least another 10%. If you don‚Äôt have flexibility you may be better off with the ICE.

Edit: I meant if you don‚Äôt have flexibility due to time constraints."
1bv4hkq,kxy2472,"I've been there a handful of times too! üòÇ I've been told I'll arrive with -5% before but after dropping the speed from 80 down to 70 I arrived with 3% once.

If you get into a pinch/long stretch just drive 5-10mph slower and you'll be fine. I've done over 115k miles and 200+ SCs on my LR RWD 3 without any issues across any decent highway üëç"
17wgbct,k9hkx6s,If it is set to assertive it will camp out on the left lane. You can change it using the right scroll wheel pressing it left or right...
17wgbct,k9idxww,I found it will only leave the left lane when a car comes up behind it. Otherwise it is happy to stay in the left lane all day.
17wgbct,k9iibv6,It will mostly stay in the middle lane
17wgbct,k9iniol,"That is included in the other things FSD doesn't understand.  It also can't understand Resume Speed, Right Turn Permitted Without Stopping, and No Turns on Red.  It doesn't understand school zone speed limits as well.  Those things are still jobs for the human."
wli231,ijv4t1p,"There is no way for anyone to communicate this to you meaningfully over the internet.  But it will be somewhat more comfortable with 18s than 20s.  Tires will also cost a lot less, and you will be way less likely to damage wheels/tires on potholes"
wli231,ijwhqeu,"Right. 
But with 20"" you'll assert dominance over the other Tesla with smaller wheels and that alone is worth it"
wli231,ijv8tin,Agreed.
wli231,ijwhz03,"I spent my 20s racing cars competitively and that first thing I did with my M3P was swap the 20""s for 18""s

No dominance concerns. Should accelerate a tiny bit quicker if anything!"
1dufjlg,lbg8amm,"I agree!!!

. There are 2 exits I don‚Äôt trust it to not hit the railing. The railings are very close to the median line and I always feel like fsd is heading straight for it at 65mph. 

A nice merging effect would be so much better"
1dufjlg,lbgnh4m,"Yea, every time FSD exits for me, my wife complains about it. It's quite abrupt, although better than it used to be."
1dufjlg,lbgtdmj,It seems like its the result of FSD switching between V12 for roads back to V11 on the highway... There are a couple exits in my area where the V12 allowed area extends onto the highway a bit for some reason and the exits there are pretty nice and smooth.
1dufjlg,lbh6xqj,"I am told by a Tesla engineer that FSD is learning from our driving habits now.  I believe him when he says this because I noticed my car is cutting corners too tight when turning.  I didn't think much of it until I rode with my wife one day.  She cuts the corners in the same way.  After a week of driving, it stopped doing this.  Maybe keep correcting it until it does what you want automatically."
1dufjlg,lbhbw5g,"I force an earlier lane change to get it into the exit lane when I normally would.¬†

Would be nice if they smoothed that out"
1dufjlg,lbicpqp,What are V11 and V12?
1dufjlg,lbif3vx,"V12 is the current neural net driven FSD that's replacing the old handwritten code.¬†


V11 is the previous hand coded FSD software they're replacing.


Currently V11 still handles the highway driving."

1bikbws,kvktrwr,Great post. Felt like I was along for the ride. Thanks!
1bikbws,kvln6do,"two things notable from my recent v12.3 drive: 1) The car changed lanes far in advance to get around a double parked car ahead, which is nicer than it getting on its ass and then waiting years before it can get around it.  2) the car properly stopped at the right spot before train tracks when there was a red light just a head of them and traffic was backed up where the next spot would be right on the tracks.  It did this 3 times so far and I dont remember it doing that so well before."
1bikbws,kvkxcmu,"I'm quite frustrated that it is single click engagement only now, no way to use cruise control only and steer myself. Mine also won't go up to the set limit without me using the accelerator to get there. I had it slowly slide into another lane on the highway without using a blinker."
1bikbws,kvq896m,"> Ok speed limit is 50, everyone else going 60, why is this thing going 43. Seriously did they use my grandma as training data? Intervention, accelerator pedals pressed.

This is the most obvious issue, and is an annoyance and safety issue. How come the social media influences gloss over this?"
1bikbws,kvkvuec,Thanks‚Ä¶crying on 2024.xx!
1bikbws,kvkymee,"Hah nice post.

One of the advantages of training with a neural network and learning algorithms instead of ""write another 2,000 lines of C code"" that they were doing with V11 is that the learning shouldn't be as brittle.

The 2,000 lines of C code always broke down as they tried to make a car not miss a lane on a weird turn, it would pop up strange things in other areas.

With the learning algorithms, they just need to identify disengagement spots and have 8 or 10 ""teaching moments"" of a car doing that spot correctly and it should ""learn"" it next time.

Yeah, certain kinds of neural networks CAN fail in brittle ways so it's not impossible they'll regress in the future (just like a human can ""get bad habits""), but in general, I doubt it'll be as stark as it was before."
1bikbws,kvlkxy7,The hesitation at stops is the car is being cautious by design and looking for your input to accelerate in certain scenarios. Just press the accelerator to give input. It will perform as you like it in a future build. It‚Äôs better to be cautious at first with something with so much new.
1bikbws,kvkyyrw,[deleted]
1bikbws,kvkvxgl,"I‚Äôm pretty impressed with it so far. It drives like a grandma but stopping and accelerating are so much smoother. 

Most of my V11 disengagements were because it would full-throttle towards traffic stopped for a red-light and hard-brake at the last second, or it wouldn‚Äôt slow down for a short turning-lane until it got towards the end. At least around where I live, these issues seem to be nearly completely gone. Only took it for a spin before work this morning so I‚Äôll take it back out later.

**Update**: Drove another ~2.5 hours. Three(?) disengagements. Previously I couldn‚Äôt even make it a mile around here in the city limits. Overall happy with this progress 

1. Turning off ‚ÄúAuto Speed‚Äù while driving bumped my Max Speed to 85mph in a 55mph zone. Couldn‚Äôt decrease it. The car didn‚Äôt start to go that fast, but I disengaged and re-engaged just to be safe. 

2. Smoothly stopped at a red light‚Ä¶ Light turns green, box-truck in front of me is taking a millennium to get up to speed, FSD seemed like it assumed the car would be going faster in that amount of time and started to quickly accelerate, I‚Äôd say I was less than a car length behind. Quickly disengaged

3. This might still be V11 highway stack(?) Non-controlled local access highway: Slowed down for a merger instead of moving to the left lane, but the merger decided to brake and match my speed instead. Disengaged to quickly move left instead of signaling for a slower auto-change"
1bikbws,kvkxnto,"Very nice post. I did one short trip this morning. V12.3 seems to track the lane better. (Rural 2 lane, yellow line down the center) V11 was always just a tad too close to the centerline for my comfort. Seems better but need more trips to be sure. 
I usually have had it set to chill. It was a bit slow here and there today. I may try normal or assertive."
1bikbws,kvlk0nq,"Great post and ty! I felt exactly as you did lol

For the stop signs, if in not mistaken they're forced to do a full and complete stop because of the NHTSA"
1bikbws,kvs3guu,"I would like to know where the car is getting speed limit info. Until v12, it was accurate in my area with a few minor exceptions. Now, it is very inaccurate in several places. 

I saw the speed limit displaying in car as only 10mph on a two lane country road for a few hundred feet where the actual speed limit is 50mph. In town with a speed limit of 25mph, the car displayed a speed limit of 50mph. Fortunately, the car never got to 50 but that may have been entirely due to another car in front of me. Maybe it read the state route 50 sign as a speed limit?

This all with the new speed limit feature turned off."
1bikbws,kvlnhox,"Thank NHTSA for all the starting stuff, as they are the ones that insist the car should behave in a distinctly dangerous way by adhering to the letter of the law rather than the spirit of the law. It‚Äôs going to cause accidents, and maybe that‚Äôs the point - they are very anti Tesla."
1bikbws,kvmiiez,Can you clarify if you were on 12.2 or 12.3? I have read a few complaints about grandma driving on 12.2 but seems to be better on 12.3.
1bikbws,kvmjres,I‚Äôll have to try changing drive modes based on your feedback. I‚Äôve been on conservative for a long time and I too feel like v12 has been overly cautious to my liking.
1bikbws,kvmvmqe,"The 12.3 release is very good and solved a lot of issues from v11. However, I live in Southern California and travel some roads outside normal city streets.  These roads often have a stop sign warning ahead sign about 300' prior to that actual Stop Sign.  Unfortunately 12.3 is seeing the Red Octagon in the warning sign and mistaking it for a stop sign . . .  and as you guessed, slowing or stopping at the warning sign. Hope they can figure a way to solve this problem.

1bikbws,kw18ajh,"I‚Äôd say this is the best review of v12 and very much aligns with my experience. It very much drives like grandma. Even when the automatic speed offset is off it still rarely hits speed limit. I‚Äôm pretty sure everyone driving behind me is cursing me out. I‚Äôve only tested it in rural streets so far.  It‚Äôs very smooth and human like, but a human that is terrified of speeding and drives very very conservatively. Changing to assertive didn‚Äôt make much of a change in how fast it drove for me, at least not on the streets I was driving on.

To be perfectly honest, I‚Äôd rollback if I could right now. I feel like I‚Äôm doing more interventions than I was before. The difference is before I was doing more steering wheel interventions and now I‚Äôm doing way more accelerator interventions so I don‚Äôt get rear ended."
1bikbws,kvl8yzq,"Fun read, thanks for the post. Also, your poor gma!"
1bikbws,kvljxz0,"Weird I haven't gotten it yet when I have almost 250,000 miles on my car."
1bikbws,kvln716,"two things notable from my recent v12.3 drive: 1) The car changed lanes far in advance to get around a double parked car ahead, which is nicer than it getting on its ass and then waiting years before it can get around it.  2) the car properly stopped at the right spot before train tracks when there was a red light just a head of them and traffic was backed up where the next spot would be right on the tracks.  It did this 3 times so far and I dont remember it doing that so well before."
1bikbws,kvmpn16,"My experience with v12, so far, has been really really good.  Only complaint is 4 way stop.   The stop, creep, stop,  creep, go - takes waaaay to long."
1bikbws,kvmrqef,"Haha, I came here to make a similar post so I‚Äôll just add to yours. I knew I had done an update but didn‚Äôt realize the magnitude, haven‚Äôt payed attention much to them lately. Boy did it take me for a ride. I was so impressed i had to check the release notes because I knew something major had changed. Mine got in a turn lane before the line designation because there was traffic and the turn lane was backed up. Was so surprised. Lane changes are so nice and assertive now. I can‚Äôt wait to see where this goes."
1bikbws,kvpn4f4,Don‚Äôt be so hard on your grandma
1bikbws,kvpz7xd,Yeah it also will not stay between the lines. It has already crossed the center line and it rode on the outside lane line multiple times. For me it‚Äôs actually less usable.
1bikbws,kvvkltw,"Second day using 12.3, this I believe is the FSD we dreamed about getting day one.  Driving around the north metro Denver/Boulder/Longmont area, in a little over 70 miles, I had one disengagement and that was leaving a parking lot and a person crossing the street but I was concerned the lady didn't think I was going to wait for her, and I think maybe 3 or 4 accelerator pushes due to being too timid.  This version definitely is pushing me to say, it might be worth the $12k extra."
1bikbws,kwa2zbg,"I like this thread so going add my common man v11 vs 12.3 opinion‚Ä¶

Pros:
1. Does better job on 2 way unlined roads. V11 would ride the middle and play chicken with oncoming traffic. V12 stays to the side and juts middle when it needs to (although it did roll over a lowered sewer grate 1/3 times. 
2. Better in parking lots (v11 would go over empty parking spots and veer around)

Cons:
1. The low speed, 55 limit, car set to 63, doing 45. Multiple times. 
2. Weird lane selection that didn‚Äôt exist in v11. 
2a. Divided Highway 2 lane express; 2 lane local. V11 got over 1-0.5 miles before split. V12 just misses the split every time not bothering to get over unless I signal it. 
2b. 2 exits after each other, car wants second exit but moves into exit lane for first exit goes about 50 feet then merges back into non-exit lane. V11 never did this."
1bikbws,kvkxyws,What driving profile do you have it on? Be curious to change it to see if that makes a difference. Also sounds like you have auto speed enabled instead of max limit. I've heard auto speed is cautious on this build but haven't been able to test myself yet üò≠üò≠
1bikbws,kvlvgsl,"> We'll see, V11 was amazing at the start too until it degraded into a pile of shit. We'll see if future version of V12 is any better. I am cautiously hopeful once again.

Omg same! I just subscibed to FSD last month and was blown away by how good V11 was! And then it started degrading towards the end to the point I no longer trust it. Some instances:
1. Maps shows car has to take a right, car is going straight instead.
2. Car almost slamming into another car in the next lane probably because it couldn't see it due to glare from the sun.
3. Missing turns again...
4. Keeps waiting to shift into HOV but never does"
1bikbws,kvmqvbi,Any improvement on autopark?
1bikbws,kvmtvee,"I got V12 this morning, thinking about giving it a go on my way home from work. There are a few areas on my route that v11 just couldn't handle properly ever. Curious to see how it does now. I think what pisses me off the most is enhanced visuals with FSD over standard autopilot. Can we just pay  $500 for that as a package upgrade, because I would"
1bikbws,kvmtwq6,"People are excited about the improvement and the potential. Of course if you judge it by what it is today, it's not good enough. That's why the label Beta is still there."
1bikbws,kvne1op,"V12 for me makes some maneuvers way way better, but has still taken really poor lines on left turns onto a divided road, aiming at the median. Also made a few bad lane choices but I think if they actually fixed the map data this would be much better.

I will try aggressive mode to turn off the grandma mode. Also I turned on auto speed today and that seems to help a lot in moderate traffic.

Also since v11 doesn't support auto speed mode, you can see on the display when it switches stacks getting on or off the highway."
1bikbws,kvo9y07,I just downloaded it so I‚Äôll try it tomorrow. Man I hope this works.
1bikbws,kvocoeu,"Wish I could pause my 3 month trial until I get V12. I tried it for a week and turned it off for good, 2 months ago."
1bikbws,kvwy5cn,Anybody noticing a regression for the auto-wipers?  Mine were very wonky this morning and seemed better on the last release of V11.
1bikbws,kvkytu6,"I would like my robot car to drive slow and carefully, if that's what you mean driving like your grandma. I wouldn't like the car to drive like a stressed out cab driver."
1bikbws,kvodn85,where experience video ?
1bikbws,kvp436i,"I flinched when I read you'll just roll over a stop sign. This is so bad in my country you pay serious fines for this and you can loose your driving license over it. If it says stop, you STOP."
1bikbws,kweyrge,"Setting it to assertive just means law breaking. Assertive with the ""you can pick the speed that seems appropriate always causes a cruise speed of 80 or 81 on the highways which all are 70 or 55.¬†

Basically you are telling the car ""screw safety, drive like all these other douchebags too"" and having it be part of the reason we have so many road deaths compared to other countries with more respect for civil engineering"
1bikbws,kvnawuh,"After additional testing I can confirm this version really is an improvement. Yes, some accelerator pressing is helpful at times but if you are willing to let FSD do its thing, it really is impressive."
1bikbws,kvo859v,"Same, it's slower than I drive even in aggressive. Can't blame them though the aim is safer than humans right? 

At the very least they seem to have implemented some  level of speed guidance with the accelerator pedal, if you push it to get a bit more speed it seems to acknowledge and try to maintain said speed even after you let go."
1bikbws,kvkyxnk,"I ran a route where V11 *always* messed up. It‚Äôs an inside left turn into four lanes where two of the lanes are left turns. V11 would consistently turn into the one of the turn lanes which was off. Today, for the first time after 100‚Äôs of previous failed attempts, it got the correct lane using V12.3 on the first try. Wow. 

Just one example from a random stranger."
1bikbws,kvncfht,real stream of consciousness writing
1bikbws,kvl1nyt,"I feel the need to voice my complaint about missing TACC every time this comes up. FSD/Autopilot still makes dumb ‚Äúroute-based‚Äù mistakes. For example, turning on the blinker for a mile to change into a lane that doesn‚Äôt exist (it won‚Äôt actually make the maneuver, thankfully) and getting out of a lane even when it doesn‚Äôt need to. Minimal Lane Changes is turned on.¬†


TACC would get me through these sections of the freeway.¬†"
1bikbws,kvky07a,Did they remove the option between single for FSDb and double for TACC + AP?
1bikbws,kvwl0mt,That is crazy that they removed this option.  Why would they do that?
1bikbws,kvnks6v,"That is frustrating. I don‚Äôt have single click on (I don‚Äôt have v12 yet) because there are so many times I‚Äôm on the freeway but FSD is being blocked on some cameras because of road spray or because it‚Äôs too dark on an extremely remote road at night, so the only cruise option is regular TACC. Now I will have to disable FSD for the entire drive instead of waiting for the cameras to regain visibility just to be able to use regular TACC?

I‚Äôm fine with FSD not being able to drive me coast to coast still, but these edge cases where I have to drop to a different Autopilot that are still not resolved in FSD, then they remove the ability to fall back, it‚Äôs just making the car more of a pain to drive."
1bikbws,kvnvnx1,I'm quite sure that you can remove one pull for Fsd and revert it to normal. That way you can use cruise control.
1bikbws,kvoxeel,You should be able to change it in the car. In think it‚Äôs just in the Autopilot screen.
1bikbws,kvlc969,Fucking me too
1bikbws,kvmlrzw,Wait why aren't we getting it??
1bikbws,kvn47ln,Interested to see how it performs on highways. Seen a lot of content related to city driving.
1bikbws,kvl5zje,You need many more than 8 or 10 teaching moments.
1bikbws,kvlm2lc,"300,000 lines of C code, I think it was"
1bikbws,kvlooci,Changing hyperparameters can wildly change the model.
1bikbws,kvlsv5r,Lol where are you getting 8-10? Makes you sounds way over the top biased
1bikbws,kvmbgiu,This is exactly my experience driving today.
1bikbws,kvpftnp,"Yea, that last part annoys me too. But then I think about the fact that this is how real people drive. Training it on real driving data may be making it a bit more like us than we want."
1bikbws,kvlcegr,The full throttle towards stopped traffic really pisses off my passengers. I'm really happy to hear v12 is doing a better job of that.
1bikbws,kvkx7se,I primarily disengage because V11 drives in the shoulder for every single right turn. Average distance between disengagements is 0.65 miles for me.
1bikbws,kvmb0bv,"Just got back from a 30+ mile round trip to the local Walmart. All rural 2 lane roads, except my own street which is single lane dirt. I didn‚Äôt have to disengage FSD until I wanted to choose my parking space at Walmart and coming back when I entered my own street. I didn‚Äôt trust it coming from 50 mph paved onto single lane dirt with deep ditches on each side. Once on my street and past the ditches I put it back in FSD and for the first time it cautiously drove at 7 mph looking for my driveway. In the past ver 11 would always try to go 25 which is a very bad idea where I am.

It does drive like a grandma, even when I set it to assertive, and I did have to encourage it with occasional touches to the accelerator. But, it is driving like a human. No more constantly being too close to the centerline. It changes speed as the speed limit changes much more smoothly. Much better speed adjustment on curves.

I am greatly encouraged by ver 12. It looks like they are on the right track."
1bikbws,kvsijk3,"From my observations the speed limit is from actual signs, or map data. But it almost seems like it completely ignores it and just drive what seems ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù for the road, traffic speed, and road conditions."
1bikbws,kvmwsw2,I‚Äôm on 12.3
1bikbws,kvnztcs,What does that have to do with anything?
1bikbws,kvlk6rn,"I have it on assertive. I did start it as auto speed then moved to max speed. But even after I changed it, it‚Äôs still very cautious and wasn‚Äôt going up to max speed."
1bikbws,kvmwwtp,No idea. I very rarely use that feature.
1bikbws,kvmxyka,"It‚Äôs getting close for sure though. All the way up until this point I couldn‚Äôt do my commute without disengagements. V12 is the first time this has happened.

Granted, it drives like a grandma right now and is honestly way too slow, and if I had a time dilation machine I‚Äôd speed up the car by 15-20% and everything would be perfect.

More test is needed, but I‚Äôm actually impressed by FSD for the first time in a while. The last time I was even surprised at all was when it was able to make a full 90¬∞ turn for the first time. Ever since that major jump, everything had been two steps forward, two steps back‚Ä¶ until now.

Now that was just my commute to work, I‚Äôm going to see how this performs the rest of the week and figure out if it‚Äôs just another hype, or maybe it‚Äôs time to look at investing in Tesla again."
1bikbws,kvxhau7,"Hasn‚Äôt rained where I am since I got V12, so I don‚Äôt know."
1bikbws,kvyucqb,"Yes, I‚Äôve seen some regression with V12.3: now the wipers activate near dawn and dusk with no rain"
1bikbws,kvl8bze,I on the other hand would not‚Ä¶ if it‚Äôs driving like a grandma I‚Äôd have to take over utterly defeating having FSD at all. Keep up with speed of traffic (better yet go at speed I tell you unless car feels it needs to slow down to do a maneuver safely). On straight road go the speed I request please.
1bikbws,kvmhrlc,"I think we should throw both those ideas out the window and say that the goal of FSD should be to avoid surprising other drivers on the road. Driving under the speed limit is surprising, and speeding and swerving between lanes is surprising."
1bikbws,kvl2l7d,"wow, didn't know those were the only two options ü•¥"
1bikbws,kvowqh7,"None, like I said, I'm not a youtuber or some influencer. I'm not gonna use my time to do that crap lol."
1bikbws,kvso204,Your country probably doesn‚Äôt have stop signs on every damned corner like the USA.
1bikbws,kw6zllv,"You must live in a country where the experts, traffic engineers, decide where Stop signs should be used, and where Yield signs should be used. In the US Yield signs are rarely used and Stop signs are used because idiots who set the signs think they will help with traffic calming."
1bikbws,kvnzrvo,"I still don't understand why ""minimal lane changes"" isn't a sticky setting between trips.

V11 simply does not understand that there are perfectly valid reasons to hang out in the right lane at a slightly slower speed than you have set for TACC. Mainly, you're getting off at the next exit. But V11 \*will\* flip on its left blinker to ""get out of the right lane"" (per the display) and canceling the merge with the turn signal \*does not work.\* Like, the feature is straight-up broken.

Similarly, even at ""chill"" settings, it will aggressively merge into a faster lane even if that lane is only faster by 2-3mph."
1bikbws,kvlvlbz,"just dont navigate anywhere and FSD will ""go straight"""
1bikbws,kvpymio,"I just updated my car last night and haven't even driven it yet.

I'm not sure I would have updated it if I knew this was the case.  On my typical highway commute I keep TACC enabled, flipping between manual steering and Autopilot based on the level of traffic.

This is going to drive me crazy."
1bikbws,kvky6ud,Yes. You have to shut off FSD and revert to autosteer to use it that way now.
1bikbws,kvkyqy0,"With V12, the releases so far seem to do that."
1bikbws,kvnysfs,Not after the new update.
1bikbws,kvptef7,Not on the new update.
1bikbws,kvlmgf7,"Same. Was so hopeful a week and a half ago when I saw there's an update pending, but realized that it's still v11."
1bikbws,kvmngxv,Tesla likes to keep the latest beta few versions behind the production software that we general public get until they have a somewhat proven version of FSD. Plus subscribing to FSD from time to time would not help as when you are not on FSD you will want to update your car to the latest build.
1bikbws,kvm5qqp,"> You need many more than 8 or 10 teaching moments.¬†


It depends a lot on the architecture of their models. Look at training LoRAs in SD. They perfected it so much that there are models that require just one photo.¬†


For a driving sim, you can also make some additional virtual examples."
1bikbws,kvl9wck,"At any given location (say a specific weirdly shaped roundabout), if you have 10 ""good driver"" approaches, a learning algorithm can take that and run with it pretty effectively I think."
1bikbws,kvlnuf8,He's talking about x lines of code for a certain situation. In total there were 300k lines removed.
1bikbws,kw9zz87,"This ^^^

As great as models are they can have unexpected regressions. Added training fit that weird round about and now the narrow road yielding behavior degraded 20% - wtf."
1bikbws,kvltaz7,"huh?

From some experience with training convolutional neural networks using reinforcement training.

Biased to what?  Neural networks?  Sure, I think they're a great solution to complex problems."
1bikbws,kvmh9yq,"My v12 did the full throttle and then stop quick thing today.

My take is that if you discount the car's acceleration problems, v12 just feels overall better.

Even with the acceleration problems, v12 is better than the last one."
1bikbws,kvnm5r8,Can you find that statistic somewhere or are you making it up as an illustration?
1bikbws,kvo15em,Because then they can get more information sent back to use for the next updates.
1bikbws,kvm2rpf,I don't know what happened to drivers in the US.  We (EU tourists) visited in the 90's and every driver was so calm and polite.  We've been back several times since then (2015 to 2022) and there's a lot of crazy on the roads now.  We visited my niece in Seattle and she literally told me I was driving her crazy by going the  speed limit!
1bikbws,kvlybz2,"The goal of FSD is to be a robotaxi, not an ideal ADAS. Driver preference for nuanced scenarios is probably something that falls in the ""not relevant, won't pursue"" bucket. Auto wipers seem very similar: strong driver preferences, but not blocking autonomy so not pursued."
1bikbws,kw7c21n,"Yes, that's exactly the case in my country. I also read that americans are too stupid for roundabouts, we do have them everywhere"
1bikbws,kvz37mh,"My guess is they want to farm disengagement data specific to inappropriate lane change maneuvers. 

Having it stickied would mean most people just leaves it on (and rightfully so, the ass backwards lane changes it insists on doing every two seconds is easily the single worst part of FSD). 

TLDR they know bad lane changes is an area of improvement and they want as much training scenarios as possible from the fleet."
1bikbws,kvnlu4e,I've had FSD (v11) tell me it was changing lanes to follow the route with no route selected.
1bikbws,kvm2t9y,"If you need to actually go somewhere, that's a valid work-around."
1bikbws,kvnp4xs,"Not true, it will take random turns occasionally."
1bikbws,kvqlurn,"Yeah, we seem like a minority to be honest. Even if I didn‚Äôt have FSD, TACC is useful for when I‚Äôm just getting onto a heavy traffic freeway - I can turn my head confidently for longer to see if I have have room to change lanes while letting the car keep a good distance in front of me.¬†"
1bikbws,kvnpeou,"I've taken Chuck Cook's advice, and I have 2 separate driving profiles. One is my normal profile with FSD beta enabled, and I have a separate one with AP only."
1bikbws,kvpr8gm,I wonder if the S3XY buttons can engage TACC... I may have to program one if it does
1bikbws,kvv9epl,But doesn‚Äôt that mean that the AI could never take a completely new road (or situation) the right way for the first time? Or could it figure it out by ‚Äúguessing‚Äù?
1bikbws,kvlwyi2,"oh yeah, thanks"
1bikbws,kvlznlw,"With so many neurons, aren't the training moments diluted by the sheer size of the tensor? You think 8-10 teaching moments are enough to have an impact?"
1bikbws,kvnrvhq,"I submit to https://www.teslafsdtracker.com/. I don't have any issues with it on the highway, but in cities it's abysmal."
1bikbws,kvo1l8l,That‚Äôs not how they determine the order in which vehicles get the updates.
1bikbws,kvm5gle,Greatly depends on area of the country. Going speed limit would drive me nuts too ;). Haven‚Äôt noticed much change in GA between 90s and now to be honest.
1bikbws,kvm0i52,That‚Äôs lovely and all‚Ä¶ but considering we all paid a chunk of cash I‚Äôd like to have driver preferences included.
1bikbws,kw7dii2,"Yes, Americans are rather bad at accepting that other counties have developed better practices than we have developed. (Not just traffic, you can also add education, guns, healthcare, food, politics etc.)"
1bikbws,kvm8rza,"It‚Äôs a workaround, but a worse one than TACC, for destinations and routes I‚Äôm not familiar with. The best workaround would be bringing back the Navigate with Autopilot toggle, updated for FSD. But probably not going to happen.¬†"
1bikbws,kvns5as,Great advice. Thanks!
1bikbws,kvptfx8,Please let me know. I'll order if so.
1bikbws,kvv9lyo,"The learning should be flexible for new roads. Like 99.99% of the time.

1bikbws,kvm114k,"You can repeat a teaching data set until the solution set is good enough, it's not simply that you will lose it in the noise, I think. 

Meaning... as long as there's enough variety (i.e. 8-10 varieties that successfully solve a certain edge case in slightly different ways) to not cause it to be a brittle solution (i.e. a quirky specialized path locking onto something specific in the environment) it should be good enough, I think."
1bikbws,kvr46pl,Do you know how they determine the order?
1bikbws,kvmqm66,Def agree... I just find it unlikely.
1bikbws,kvt6qrc,"As of now, it does not. It has distinct functions for AP and TACC but the command it sends for both puts it into FSD AP. 

A plus is I observed on the controls screen, I can set it to Autosteer (Beta) from FSD (Beta) to allow me to use TACC, but then Tesla does not allow switching back. This version is a big FAIL imho because of this."
1bikbws,kvvaax2,"So, corrections would always be required for perfect driving. I.e. one can never rely fully on the car fully taking control without a competent driver in the car?"
1bikbws,kvta0mi,Agreed. Biggest step back in the almost decade of driving these cars. Can't stand this new update.
1bikbws,kvw8vf7,"That's probably not correct.

I suspect a good enough AI that's struggling with a section of road would do what a human would do and slow down a bunch and take a best effort, which might not be perfect, but could be good enough.

I'm talking about being able to drive it smoothly and fluently.

AIs absolutely will be better drivers than humans in your lifetime.  Whether that's 2 years away or 10, I'm not sure."

11moao7,jbircsv,"Looks like auto lane change cannot be disabled while on the highway anymore.

Well, you can, but it resets each drive.  https://youtu.be/qt56idWv9rw?t=263

[This bit here](https://youtu.be/qt56idWv9rw?t=1162), is why I was dreading FSD Beta on the highways.  The logic of Navigate on Autopilot, which appears to be carrying over here, is changing lanes based on distance to target.  You're given about one mile for each lane you need to move over to get off the highway.  So on a three lane highway, if you're in the left most lane, it's going to start trying to get into the center lane about two miles before the exit, and if you're in the center lane, it's going to try and get over about one mile from the exit.  Dude's 1.3mi from the exit, and the car decides to get into the far left lane to pass the truck, which is *technically* correct, however, in this instance the car should have gotten into the right lane, even though it'd be passing on the right, the time to pass the semi is too high.  I particularly dislike how he edited the video to avoid showing how the correction was handled.  The exit he's showing appears to be a different exit than the clip before.  Lane changing for highways needs to put more effort on ""Don't miss my exit"" and increase the ""Get into the lane for the exit earlier, if possible"".  That we can't really turn off the lane changing behavior is going to cause a number of issues."
11moao7,jblzg4g,"I don't think I've seen this, but if you turn off FSD in Autopilot settings and just have self-steering on, do the visualizations revert to production AP?

Obviously I'm not an OG beta tester so I don't have version 11 yet.

Main reason I'm asking: when they roll this into non FSD cars what will  AP look like?"
11moao7,jbj9urm,Yeah the edit to show how it handled getting past the truck was odd . That‚Äôs what we want to see . Passing your exit in some cities could easily add 30 minutes to your trip .
11moao7,jbivksy,"Is the Turn Off Auto Lane change icon still available? Even with the current version (pre v11), I found it useful. For example, it always try to get off the HOA lane now (maybe it is the left most lane and considered as passing lane?) By keeping NoA off till close to exit, I can keep it in HOA lane"
11moao7,jbkfnv7,"Yeah... on my commute (Boston), if you aren't in the exit lane 3+ miles in advance sometimes, you aren't getting in. At least not without being a total asshole and cutting off 100 people. 

I always had to keep speed based changes disabled because it would want to get out of the ""slow"" lane, which is really just cars queuing for the exit I need to get to. FSD also does this often enough with cars lining up to turn left at an intersection or something. The car thinks that they're just parked and it wants to get around them... It feels very much like the behavior was created in a place with very different driving culture."

Anyone driving behind me sees my signal start flashing and the car start to move over like every 15 seconds while I fight to cancel it."

Totally agree.  I know they want to invest in NN based solutions to make this better but it's disappointing to see they couldn't come up with a better procedural rules based approach to these tasks in the last several years.

&#x200B;

I think they should use an opportunistic approach to making lane changes and try to assess how congested traffic is.   When traffic is less congested the car can wait longer to get over vs when it's congested.  Then the car should take opportunities to move over within the low priority distance opportunistically but if it gets within the priority distance it should take more assertive actions like slowing down or speeding up to find a spot.  They have had years to make this better and basically done nothing as far as I can tell.  


float lowPriorityLaneChangeDistance;

float highPriorityLaneChangeDistance;  


If (traffic is congested) {

   lowPriorityLaneChangeDistance=1;

   highPriorityLaneChangeDistance=.5;  


} else {

  laneChangeBeforeExitMiles=.5;

   highPriorityLaneChangeDistance=.25;

}"
11moao7,jbn6ou2,There's the option to minimize lane changes. You see some other highway drives where they stay on the right/middle of the highway.
11moao7,jbm0kt2,"I imagine it'll look like it does now, as long as you have AP3"
11moao7,jbjajqv,"Correct.

I'm sure what was removed was unsafe acceleration to pull ahead, followed by cutting over two lanes, all manual driving."
11moao7,jbivpln,"The button to turn off Navigate on Autopilot when you've entered a destination?  I don't recall seeing the button in his clips.  Makes sense as Navigate on Autopilot is basically not there anymore, it's just the FSD Beta code doing it all."
11moao7,jbkg21u,"Correct.  Some exits are just bad, and suck, and waiting is your best option, but FSD Beta don't be like that.  That's, honestly, been one of my fears, and expectations with the FSD Beta roll out.

That said, there was a mention by Elon, which I can't find at the moment, where he said that one of the next improvements is going to be like an ""intent neural network"", or something like that, where they'll start analyzing people's behaviors around certain exits and such, and then adjust the behavior so it acts more like the people who do it day to day."
11moao7,jbkmmru,"I'd be ok with this if it was the button like NoA being turned on at the start of every drive, and you could push the button if the lane changing was getting annoying."
11moao7,jbnt321,"The car tends to prefer to be in the middle of the highway, which makes sense, because it ensures that as you're passing highway on-ramps, that you're not going to obstruct people from getting onto the highway which, to me, is optimal behavior.  You should strive to remain in the right lane as much as possible, but on a three lane highway, I don't see anything wrong with being in the middle lane, as long as you're at least about 5mph over the speed limit.

If you're going to ride the right lane, the ""gentlemanly"" thing to do, to me, has *always* been to get over one lane at the on-ramps, especially if you know it's either a busy one, or there's cars on it.  People who force others to merge onto the highway around them, suck."
11moao7,jbn29wf,"I'm not so sure.

In keeping with Elon's mantra of ""delete the part or the process"", if unifying the stack is all about bringing FSD into standard AP (one stack to rule them all), why keep two different visualizations?

It's not like they haven't rolled FSD features into non FSD software before (e.g. green light chimes).

Just seems it would be simpler to kill all old AP code.  Sure visualizations aren't a heavy lift, but...."
11moao7,jbjb81i,üòÇ oh I‚Äôm sure it was .
11moao7,jbj5bko,"Yes. If so, that sucks. Hopefully Tesla can soon distinguish HOA lane from passing lane, so it can stay in HOA without turning of Keep Off Passing Lane option."
11moao7,jbp9ms4,"See, this is the problem with trying to make generalized solutions to every situation. Most of the time I'm in the opposite situation, wondering why the car's bugging me to move over when the exit is still 2 miles away! I generally don't want to be in the exit lane until my exit is the next one, after I've passed all the others merging in. Which is usually 1/2 - 1/4 miles.

Needing / wanting to be in the right lane *more* than 3 miles away is mind-boggling. And I'm also in Boston! I-95 / I-93 can be pretty crazy, but you're still best off moving into the lane for your exit *after* gaps open up from the people getting off at the one before..."
11moao7,jbknkab,[deleted]
11moao7,jbnsuo4,"They can't kill the older code because, as I understand it, the older AP hardware can't do what AP3 hardware can do.

the HW2/2.5 computer basically won't get the FSD Beta code improvements.  They're at the end of the line unless you pay for the $1,000 computer upgrade, which I imagine will get cheaper down the road to encourage people to upgrade."
11moao7,jbq5lny,"Currently even with V11 there's still an option in settings to revert back to legacy Autopilot. I'm sure they'll remove that option eventually, but the new stack literally just got enabled on the highway, so it'll take at least a few months of validation before it makes sense to remove the option of reverting to the old stack."
11moao7,jbpcht1,"So, I try to look at this as more of a ""long term"" approach than a ""near term"" one.

While the logic is, at the moment, a little unsound, in the long term it'll smooth out as more vehicles start to use self driving technologies, and traffic issues start to smooth out.

Most traffic issues, in my opinion, are human generated, from people road raging, to missing their exits, taking the wrong exits, being distracted and missing a light, etc, etc, long term shit like this won't matter because automation will kind of sort it out.

Near term, yeah, waiting three miles for the exit seems a bit of a stiff treatment, but if that's what the exit calls for.

The other thing that causes an exit to backup is people cutting in front of other people to get further ahead in the line.  If you're one of these people, you're part of the problem"
11moao7,jbko6lj,"I dunno.  I think lane changing selection has gotten better recently.  I've started leaving auto lane change on in my vehicle, and honestly I haven't had too many scenarios where it made a *dumb* lane change decision.  Most of my issues at the moment are when I make lane changes that traverse OSM lane fork junctions, like [this one](https://imgur.com/X0h68ho), you can see the fork junction as the gray circle with a ""Y"" in the middle.  If I'm in a lane change as it traverses this node, the car freaks out and tries to go back from whence it came.  If these types of issues are resolved, I think my complaint about it will be gone.

However, I do say this as a person who doesn't really drive in thick city traffic, so my thoughts on it are a bit skewed."

8y1ngw,e27dlvp,"Interesting to note the lack of Model Y talk still. Tesla being a little more disciplined about that, I think.

The design-for-manufacture of Model Y is supposed to be impressive (from hints), and perhaps they've even learned some things recently and are doing a design rev on that.

It would be nice to hear that they had a plans for a 500K-1M unit line for Model Y to complement the Model 3 forecast production.

I tend to believe reports that the Bolt is not profitable, possibly even costing GM money.

8y1ngw,e286lr1,"The one point that Merrill (and honestly most analysts) misses is that Tesla is not just vertically integrated with regards to vehicle and battery production.  They have also created a proprietary charging network which is something that no other manufacturer can say.  Other EV manufacturers have made no real effort in - instead choosing to offload this important step to private industry and third parties.  While it makes sense from a financial perspective - not having the capital outlay to build and maintain charging points - it ultimately hurts the growth of EVs as the experience with third parties is not consistent across the same network, let alone across cities or lesser traveled areas. 

I think that no manufacturer could be considered a true competitor to Tesla without the significant growth and improvement of the 3rd party charging network, or a manufacturer (or consortium) supported network. "
8y1ngw,e2aaybt,"Depends on what you mean by win.

And yet investors dont seem to understand that."

8y1ngw,e27pj0d,"> Tesla has cars with level 2-3 (V1) available in the public but are still a bit off from road testing level 4-5 (V2)

This explains it.  Their names for V1 and V2 are right next to the official ubiquitous L1-L5 autonomous driving standards.

Level 1 is you driving.  

Level 2 is cruise control or autopilot - you driving but the car helping to take some stresses away.  

Level 3 is you driving in a supervisory role, closing your eyes or looking away from the road is technically OK as long as you take over the instant the car asks you to.  The only level 3 car you can buy is an Audi, with a 35 mile per hour top speed.   

Level 4 is a fully autonomous car driving with a person in the driver's seat but not needing their assistance, the human takes over if desired or needed but the car is more autonomous than level 3, this is the lowest mode where you should be actually allowed to close your eyes for real.  

Level 5 can operate without a human present.  Take a nap in the back if you like."
8y1ngw,e27lxcr,"V1 is for Level 2-3,the first version of autonomous driving they rolled out, not to be confused with AP1.

V2 is the advanced, level 4-5 of autonomous driving, not to be confused with AP2.

I would assume AV means ""autonomous vehicle"", so V2 AV would be a level 4-5 autonomous vehicle."
8y1ngw,e27n7ck,"Software is the intent, although it's possible V2 will require a hardware upgrade. Pretty clear that Tesla is at least 3-4 years away from FSD with a small amount of risk that it's beyond possible for them given their current approach. "
8y1ngw,e27v8n0,"I understand this to mean that Tesla is taking a fundamentally different approach. Rather than a small fleet of LADAR equipped test vehicles undergoing testing in limited markets \ scenarios, they have a large fleet of Radar\Optical cars gathering data and sending it back to the mothership for processing. Since they are able to test against real world data they don't feel like they need to put car's out in the wild just yet. It doesn't mean they are falling behind per se.

Could just be the cool-aid talking."
8y1ngw,e27m2mg,I think they're using V1 to describe the level 2-3 autonomy (EAP?) and V2 to describe level 4-5 (FSD?). AV I think just means Autonomous Vehicle.

Level 4-5 = FSD (V2)

Curious if people with only EAP can opt to participate in the Telsa Network (Mobility Model) given the hardware is the same. Also Level 5 does not require a steering wheel."
8y1ngw,e27pxe0,Elon said they have two versions of Autopilot in parallel development. One version uses simpler approach and is working reasonably well while the other version uses more complex approach is trickier.

8y1ngw,e27vz1t,"Does it have to be profitable though?

You mentioned the Bolt, clearly GM isn't hurting despite selling a good amount of these cars. There's no reason to think Porsche, BMW, and other manufacturers have to worry about a small segment of their overall product line being profitable. Tesla **has** to worry about that because it's their entire product line (EVs) or it's going to be the majority of their sales (Model 3).

As far as competitors:

The Kona Electric is likely to be <$40K (it's priced that way in Sweden if you convert it right now - though it could be raised/lowered when offered in the US to not be a 1:1 exchange)

The Nissan Leaf *kind of* competes in that it's an EV at a similar (lower in this case) price point. It's not as nice as the Model 3 and the range is less (150 miles).

The BMW Mini E looks actually decent. It's due out in 2019. Details are sparse for range and pricing

BMW IX3 has 250 miles of range. Might be priced at ~$40K

The Volvo XC40 electric is set to hit in 2019, but again, details are sparse

"
8y1ngw,e27ue3c,"I think if other manufacturers scale to the same production levels as Tesla they can make money.

The problems are :-

1. Getting sufficient batteries.

2. Loss of ICE sales.

As EV volumes are constrained by battery production volumes to a level likely less than the growth in demand, there is no immediate problem for Tesla."
8y1ngw,e27up1s,"That's what I'm most interested in. While having competitors for the S and X probably won't do Tesla any favors (beyond possibly having other companies making efforts to normalize EV ownership), it's important to realize that Tesla made those first because getting the price/performances/features to line up was easy. Releasing S/X competitors but not offering anything cheaper means you're competing with with Tesla of 3-5 years ago.

That said, for now it's hard to blame GM if they're not making much/any profit on the Bolt, as Tesla can't yet make EVs in that price range and turn a profit, either. I wonder much room there is for the production cost of the Bolt to drop?"
8y1ngw,e27xyld,"Which Model 3 price bracket are you referring to? The base, unavailable $35K version, the full-out $78K one, or ???"
8y1ngw,e28r6ib,"Investments in the charging network, direct delivery, together with over the air updates are major competitive advantages that cannot easily be matched by other manufacturers.

"
8y1ngw,e27t7sx,Good question. Seems like GA2 has peaked at 1k a week and they are ok with that.

Possible use the funds to upgrade the tent if they feel the then new updated weekly figure can make them profitable.
8y1ngw,e27yfhj,"It's not going to be $1 billion, that assumes every one converts and contributes the $2.5K.

Don't know when/if the $35K version will ever be available, but it's pretty clear we're close to hitting the 200K sales that will start sunsetting the the $7500 credit.

A lot of the folks who thought they'd be able to get a Model 3 for a net price of $27,500 are not going to pony up $20,000 - $50,000 more for a more optioned version sans tax credit."

8y1ngw,e280ftg,"Level 2 is actually same as 3 but the human has to supervise constantly because the car doesn‚Äôt know for sure when it‚Äôs in trouble. 

Level 3 just means you need to be ready to take over anytime immediately, when the car tells you.

Level 4 means you don‚Äôt need to supervise, the car can safely handle some situations 100%, and for ones it can‚Äôt, it can safely pull over without human intervention. You don‚Äôt actually need a human driver for level 4, but you might end up stranded. 

Level 5 just means it can operate as good or better than a human in all situations.

Level 4 offers full autonomy, including without a human present, but is limited in some way, typically geofenced to work within a mapped area, under ideal weather conditions, limited traffic, etc.  Level 5 is capable anywhere, anytime, and under any conditions that a human would be able to operate a vehicle.

Waymo is operating some vehicles at level 4.  Fully autonomous without a human present, but only within mapped areas, and likely also limited by weather conditions."

From what I've read about the fiasco of the Opel/PSA sale, the price increase, and the *planned* production increase of only 20%, I really doubt GM can make a profit on the Bolt any time soon. They buy a big chunk of the car from LG, that alone makes it harder to make a profit, and it may be that LG is unable or unwilling to increase production, which again brings us back to problems of scale.

Tesla on the othr hand, is probably more vertically integrated than any other car manufacturer, which has resulted in a heavy debt load, but that's more or less to plan. Now the hotly contested and often disparaged ramp up looks to actually happen, that same vertical integration means a higher potential profit margin."
8y1ngw,e2835x2,"I could be mistaken. But from what I have read, GM is actually losing money on each Bolt sold. As in it costs more in parts and labor to build it than what they get from the customer.

Tesla on the other hand does make a profit on each car, just not enough to cover debt which is why they are not profitable as a company. The standard range Model 3 might cost more to make after labor is added in. But if they make enough in a single day then the profit outweighs the loss in labor costs which equals positive income. The ~~$24,000~~ $14,000 mark up for the long range premium version surely covers all of these costs at low volume which is why that was the first option of the Model 3 available.

Now that being said. If GM isn't losing too much money per Bolt sold, then it stands to reason if they increase production on it like Tesla is trying to do, then they could turn a profit in total at some point."

8y1ngw,e28e96e,"It makes sense though, they want to prove that they can be profitable before investing into the second line in order to be able to raise capital more effectively for future expansion."
8y1ngw,e27y3tr,Is there demand for more than the current run rate of GA2 (S/X)? Makes no sense to spend money to increase capacity only to not use it.
8y1ngw,e29q166,"Honestly I'd love to know the percentage of Tesla owners who actually use the superchargers daily vs weekly vs monthly vs annually vs never. 

I think many people can easily get around on 200+ miles per day. I feel like I drive a lot but it's rare for me to really do more than 100 miles in a day. Sure, road trips, but how often does the average Tesla owner actually go on a road trip that requires supercharger use?

I know some people use it more often because maybe they can't charge at home or work, and maybe some people actually do enough miles per day to need more than the 200 miles on a daily basis, but I think most probably don't use them *that* often. I also wouldn't count opportunity charging in this, I'm thinking more in cases where the range is 50% or less. "
8y1ngw,e2b3f68,"sure, but at what speed? and the fiddlyness of using a non tesla plug-n-go charger in the Uk is ridiculous"
8y1ngw,e29dkx1,Yeh i should have phrased better. I'd love to read the reports without being a client just for the insight. 
8y1ngw,e27oqg0,"Just a cost paid upfront.  However, it does let you time-shift some of your revenue from future quarters."
8y1ngw,e27uo8u,"No, I said that kinda wrong.

Should have said Tesla won't be able to hold of a capital raise with just the $2.5K deposits. But they would raise more capital to fund capex, so my reply kind of works indirectly."
8y1ngw,e2841ze,"Level 4 is limited in some way, but if the limitation is only area, say within a mapped geofenced area, it is effectively equivalent to level 5 within that area.  So for something like a taxi service confined to a mapped city area, there is effectively no difference in operation.  The difference is that you couldn't take that vehicle and expect it to work in a different city that hasn't been mapped out and loaded into the vehicle.  Just saying because depending on the use case, ""driver eventually available"" isn't really accurate.  A simple def would be ""Level 5 with some limitations"", be that area, weather, traffic, etc."
8y1ngw,e27wdaj,"Tesla's FSD by their terms is level 5, possibly level 4.  Their EAP is defined as level 4, it's pretty clearly not just level 3 with its fully autonomous parking level 5 abilities on private property.  We'll see if sales definitions meet real features whenever they start delivering."
8y1ngw,e281r6p,If you are in the US. There are talks that the incentives could be extended longer. I'm not sure I hold much hope for that but you need to call your state reps and explain that you would like to see them push for this.
8y1ngw,e2a1p1e,"The problem is that no one of them has to crush Tesla. Even if seven different manufacturers each sell 10,000 competing offerings at a loss, that could really tear into Tesla‚Äôs market share. 

And the reality is that the other companies are in a financial position advantage that they can absorb that loss, but Tesla can‚Äôt."
8y1ngw,e282lcu,"They basically said the same thing going from the Model X to the 3. However they were not expecting 400k+ pre-orders and I understand multiple place where they got hung up during this manufacturing battle. I suspect the Model Y will go smoother than the 3 but still end up with its own surprises. Each iteration will learn from the last but hit new obstacles unfortunately.

I have been through multiple product iterations with multiple companies, both in hardware manufacturing and in software. No matter what the promises are of a new, better, cheaper, faster design, something always holds it up and delays the release or has unexpected problems after release that was not seen in house."
8y1ngw,e28jwww,"Thank you for pointing that out. This is almost never highlighted in any articles I have read of late. The NYT piece made a point of Tesla making their own seats, which is very very uncommon, but the economic aspect vertical integration is more nuanced.

Large manufacturers have spent the last 30 years extracting profit via globalization from lower labor costs.  With the coming of more automation, those benefits evaporate, and your left with a sprawling behemoth, prime for implosion.

I believe the key to this vision is the Gigafactory itself, raw materials in one end, cars out the other."

what does that even mean"
8y1ngw,e28c2hd,"I think you mean $14,000, right? $9k for the battery and $5k for the upgrades.

It's totally possible that GM could decrease costs by increasing production volume, but it's also by no means guaranteed. They could be making them as efficiently as they currently know how to. Optimizing to reduce the amount of labor which goes into each car isn't necessarily quick or easy (Tesla's been at it for a year with the Model 3).

I guess time will tell!"

8y1ngw,e2a9ow6,"Again, Tesla is a rapidly moving target, there is no actual competitor to the base model 3, (agreed, there is no base model 3 either yet) and from Shauncore's list, none actually planned. Tesla has the lead, it's their's to lose, not the competitors to win."
8y1ngw,e288stz,"Slightly different phrasing, but that's what I said. How smooth (or how much less stressful maybe?) it goes, will depend on how Mr Musk and his engineers resist the urge to improve the product. Better is the enemy of the good, I guess.

This is one of the things that Toyota did well, at least in the early days, a new model would have significant % of common parts with a proven design wherever possible. If they can simply put a new body on the 3 and call it good......Normally, that would cause issues, stretching the base vehicle that much, but the 3, like the S, has such a stable base, I think it could do it well. And only use the falcon doors if they can take them essentially unchanged from the X. I wouldn't even suggest that normally, given the headache they turned out to be, but they have been extremely well received, and if you've got them sorted....."
8y1ngw,e28wumu,"Well, and also some of those emerging markets with lower labor costs (and suicide nets in the ‚Äúworker dormitories‚Äù) have begun to slowly catch up to the declining wages of manufacturing jobs in the west. 

So it was either continue pushing further for cheap labor, as in to begin to exploit Africa to continue to race towards ‚Äúthe bottom‚Äù to maximize quarterly profits, or just produce the car with your own employees with a better turn-around time on engineering specs vs manufacturing reality leading to better products in quicker time. "
8y1ngw,e28srjb,"Seems clear enough to me, why should they make a small profit from the cheap version right now, when they have a stack of more profitable orders to work through?"
8y1ngw,e2hns1x,"I recently saw that Elon talked about GM using the Bolt to maximize the benefits of ZEV credits, and that he didn't think they would make more than 25,000 - 30,000 a year, because after that, they *would* be losing money. Given the projected increase in Bolt production, which would put the numbers right around 25,000.......certainly gives a certain credence to Elon's comments."
8y1ngw,e29p9n1,">It's totally possible that GM could decrease costs by increasing production volume, but it's also by no means guaranteed.

This applies to Tesla as well."
8y1ngw,e27g80a,I don't understand how you're confused. Clearly that explains why getting to 10k is a much bigger and expensive undertaking 
8y1ngw,e2958f0,That's a good point.  It does at least let you time-shift your cash flow.
8y1ngw,e299t21,"When configuring the original $1,000 reservation becomes non-refundable and the additional $2,500 to place the order is non-refundable. "
8y1ngw,e2f8lpd,Rapidly moving backwards yeah.
8y1ngw,e2hirej,"Is winning enough? I don‚Äôt think people are arguing that the competition will ever beat Tesla in sales. There is a big difference between being #1 with 90% market share vs being #1 with 55% market share..The problem is that even a #1 ranking in sales doesn‚Äôt bring in enough cashflow to keep the expense paid.

What if the Tesla S, X, 3, and Y are the best-selling EVs in the market but the company is still losing $1B per year? (which is a drastic improvement from the almost $4B per year they‚Äôre burning through today)

"
8y1ngw,e290s91,"Agreed.  

Plus China basically has asserted leadership in Africa."
8y1ngw,e29v8kj,Naturally! I acknowledged that Tesla's been at it for a while with the Model 3. Hopefully they can keep that up.
8y1ngw,e27ignw,"Not really.  Once you have one line working and you've got all the kinks out, adding another line with the same design should be relatively simple."
8y1ngw,e29oups,"What he's saying is that it's non-refundable if Tesla deliver you a product or if you cancel. If you don't cancel and they fail to deliver a Model 3 to you, then it will have to be refunded. So they can't automatically count it as income."
8y1ngw,e2hjjx0,"Do you really think that if they are selling that many they will be still losing cash?

The current debts are mostly development related and capital infrastructure,  in my opinion they have already turned the corner on spending. They will still be investing, but this will be matched by increasing production, and thus income.

Remember the BMW report? According to that, in terms of production costs,they can make money now on the *base* model, never mind the ones they currently have coming off the line."
8y1ngw,e27kb2l,Likely paint shop limitations causes significant capex and time to go beyond 7k/week Model 3 with combined Model S/X production too.
8y1ngw,e27ivbl,"Conceptually simple maybe, cheap or quick, nope.. They don't have the cash on hand for that kinda capex without an equity raise
"
8y1ngw,e27t5z6,"Relatively simple if you have the $1 billion laying around to spend, staff to set it up and work it out (its not like 1 thing...still requires getting everything working right), and the space to put it."
8y1ngw,e28c6s1,They don't have space at fremont to add a line the size of GA3. They will need to find additional factory space (they are expanding fremont) before they can hit 10k.
8y1ngw,e2sldgg,"That report talks about how much they could make IF they were producing them at full scale, normalized, efficient mass production levels of operations. The cost of making the car isn‚Äôt just the materials, right? The factories and manufacturing operations have a certain baseline cost that can get spread out over all the cars they produce...so the more they produce, the cheaper it is per car.

So yes, I agree...IF Tesla is pumping out 10,000 Model 3s per week using normal 5-day, two-shift operations without major quality problems that require rework or warranty work...they will then be massively profitable.

The problem is that Tesla hasn‚Äôt established they can do that yet. They can‚Äôt even do half that yet. (The last update required 3 shifts/day running 7 days per week. Not only is that much more expensive, 7-days per week is also not a sustainable practice.)

Tesla is saying they should be there sometime in 2019. (But remember they also said the‚Äôd be at 5,000/week in 2017 too.)  But let‚Äôs presume it‚Äôs true. Do they have enough cash to survive til then? If not, do they have access to more? 

These are the questions that are ‚Äî IMHO ‚Äî more crucial to how nice the car is or where it ranks in sales...hence my argument that the Tesla 3 can be #1 in market share but still be in trouble financially.  And that‚Äôs why it really does matter whether they have 80% market share vs 51% market share.

In both cases, Tesla can claim they‚Äôre #1. But in the second case, they might not be selling/building cars fast enough to pay their bills.

This is why all the competition is so dangerous for Tesla. No one is saying Porsche, Nissan, or Chevy are going to end Tesla‚Äôs reign as the most superior car. But they can do a ton of damage in just chipping away at sales at a time where every week and every dollar counts.

"
8y1ngw,e2854ya,This is the problem.  There is a lot Tesla could do if they had capital.  But it looks like they're going to be stuck with a snails pace of growth if they are going to self fund everything with profits.  And making profits is going to be a bad thing for them at this time.  Investors are going to start looking at them like a real company and realize the evaluation is nowhere close to reality.  It would almost be better to stay in the hyper-fast borrow and grow and worry about profitability in the future mode for some time.  Otherwise the brakes will be coming on hard soon.
8y1ngw,e27udfo,"I mean, they already built a second line."
8y1ngw,e2uet2e,"Do you have a link to the wording of that report? I've only ever seen snippets.

I am very interested to see the Q2 report on Aug 1, even more the results for Q3 when they come out. I think, that they are already making money on the 3, not a lot maybe, but something, and the percentage will steadily ramp up to the point they can produce the base model at a profit too. At that point, I can't see any current combination from other manufacturers that will erode their sales enough to be a problem. From my point of view, nobody can realistically produce a competitive volume vehicle in the next 2 years. By then, the Y will be well underway, also the semi and pick up. And no, I don't think that will result in massive increase in debt load either. Tesla has overall a very efficient development group, it only looks spendy because they are growing from scratch, and have been re-inventing so much, which they don't have to do so much of for the next models."
mbetme,gs78913,"It's true - I love my Tesla but when I purchased it in 2019 it said ""self driving on city streets at the end of the year"". That didn't happen. There was talk of summer 2020, that didn't happen. Last week there was a promise of a download button for the beta, I got really excited about that, and then that didn't happen.

I paid 6k for something I haven't gotten to use it. I'm getting really annoyed at Tesla. They have proven time and time again to mislead us.

I would 100% sign a lawsuit at this time."
mbetme,gs93v4n,You‚Äôre bringing up a serious issue that people slam and try to cancel others when discussing this. These conversations are way past due. It‚Äôs unbelievable what Tesla/Musk has been getting away with. Their customer service is atrocious and ranked very low on JD powers. I really hope Tesla gets its act together or pushes Elon out. Like I‚Äôve heard by many people that the media lets Elon off easy. He‚Äôs a cool guy ! But fact > fiction. This is a real company that‚Äôs making real promises. There is no excuse to pump FSD then not fulfill.
mbetme,grxfbk5,"A big, fat class action. Tesla's disclaimers don't protect them from legal action, especially given Elon's tweets."
mbetme,gry23zi,"I think a lot of us are talking past each other. I'm not hearing anyone suggest Tesla would be likely to *lose* a case like this, so all the talk about their disclaimers and theoretical ways out are kind of irrelevant. The question is whether or not they can be taken to court in the first place, and the answer is surely an emphatic *yes*, provided someone can organize the money and a capable legal team. I don't doubt Tesla could marshal the resources to ultimately defend themselves against just about any claim, or at least outlast their challengers. But that really isn't the point.

Just bringing this FSD racket to light in a messy, public trial sounds to me like a long overdue corrective measure for Elon's increasingly delusional agitprop approach to Twitter and their bizarre pricing scheme in which a technology that's years away keeps rising in cost today. And if it scares future Tesla owners away from wasting an enormous chunk of the car's sticker price on the most overpriced ""feature"" this side of a Rolls Royce invoice, that's worth it to me. I just want to see some cold water dumped on the smug, unearned certainty that washes over Elon whenever he talks about this topic. We all need a reality check sometimes, and I think that moment has arrived for him.

I love Tesla cars and I'm very excited about our self-driving future. I just know it's not going to be *truly* ready any time soon, and I'm tired of a company that otherwise does great things reaping thousands of dollars from their own customers simply because they gave a charismatic CEO the benefit of the doubt. I hate seeing people get ripped off, and that's all this is at this point."
mbetme,gs1d7sq,"No idea, but I personally am upset about it. The gap between what was promised in the marketing of 2016/2017 and what has been delivered 4 years later is pretty huge.

I get that most everyone here seems really enthused about ""wow, my car did this thing correctly a few times in a row"" and I understand why. But for me, a car is an appliance. It gets me from point A to point B. The claims of 2016 and 2017 strongly implied only legal barriers to inattention and autonomy. Look at the video of the time -- ""driver is just here for legal reasons"" is such malarky, either the whole thing was massively faked (probably) or driver was there to keep the car from plowing into things just like you are there to keep the car from plowing into things today -- and the ""car is coming from LA to NYC to come get you"" tweet. Was vapor 3 years ago. Is just as vaporous today.

The payoff for me is *not* that the car can do a parlor trick of driving itself while I pay careful attention to make sure it doesn't plow into ma-maw because her jazzie is flying the jolly roger in the back and so it does not register as a thing; but rather in allowed inattention. Of which there is not a single section of the road where the car behaves well enough today that I would feel comfortable reading a book or doing email.

I would absolutely join a class action that asked for the entire price of the car. FSD claims of the time are the reason that I bought the car."
mbetme,grxdu0q,"Here's the disclaimer under the FSD order button. It's pretty clear Tesla is obligated to deliver FSD to the best of their ability; but there's no legal liability if they're unable to:

> The currently enabled features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous. The activation and use of these features are dependent on achieving reliability far in excess of human drivers as demonstrated by billions of miles of experience, as well as regulatory approval, which may take longer in some jurisdictions. As these self-driving features evolve, your car will be continuously upgraded through over-the-air software updates."
mbetme,grxv22r,"I think this is a great question and I'm glad to see it discussed.

Many in here seem to believe that a simple disclaimer acts like a ""get out of jail free"" card for Tesla. Thankfully that's not how the law works. They can't offer a tangible product for sale and then never deliver it saying ""Well you agreed that it might never be delivered,"" especially if it can be demonstrated that Tesla knew internally that there was a real chance of it never happening. That's a potential fraud case.

I think we're quickly approaching ""put up or shut up"" time. Many people who ordered FSD when it first came out in 2016 have already sold their cars. We have it documented that Tesla valued FSD at $0 for trade-ins, and the private market isn't much different. I think Tesla is going to start releasing iterative features that they can call ""FSD"" to keep the mob at bay, but in the end I think it's highly unlikely that they will deliver anything that could be reasonably called ""full self driving"" in the near future, and with given the magnifying glass they are under, I think it's probably that this lands in court in the next 2 years or so and I think it's likely that Tesla loses.

To me the only question is how badly they lose and whether FSD purchasers are actually made whole. I personally think that FSD should be refunded, fully to those buyers who have it seperate from EAP and partially to those buyers who purchased it combined with EAP. A class action where each purchaser gets a check for a couple hundred bucks isn't sufficient, though I guess that it's the most likely outcome."
mbetme,gs4by6v,"The fact of the matter is, virtually nobody with any experience in autonomous vehicles, believes Tesla hardware isn‚Äôt even remotely approaching what is needed for autonomous driving. The camera they have been used for example are only rated out for a limited distance. If the manufacturer of the camera says it‚Äôs only good for 120 feet, but Tesla is advertising far beyond that on its website‚Äîthat is clearly fraud."
mbetme,grxfkxf,"I don‚Äôt know what the legal ramifications are but I am increasingly skeptical of FSD and am not sure it was worth paying for. By the time it comes I may be ready for a new car and FSD isn‚Äôt transferable. 

I hope they allow transfers, at least for people that ordered years before it was ready"
mbetme,grzffmi,"‚ÄúIt can self drive sort of‚Äù is not the same as ‚Äúfull self driving‚Äù.

What has been accomplished to date is impressive but far from the most difficult part of autonomous driving.

The videos make it seem like we‚Äôre < 1 year away from L5, but in reality the solution set required to deliver an arbitrary car to an arbitrary customer and take them autonomously to an arbitrary destination autonomously is not even close"
mbetme,gs6yhug,"Two point, the deferred revenue is listed as a liability based on accounting guidance not Tesla‚Äôs own calculation of the risk.

The financial liability is fairly small, even if they had to payback the full value customers paid.

Assume 1M cars sold, 40% take rate on FSD, average price of $6.5k, and 50% of the feature set delivered, its $1.3B of risk they have to pay back to owners, interest is not material.

Even if this happened, Tesla got a free $1.3B loan. The damage to the reputation and value of the company for failing to deliver would far outweigh the the cash cost of damages."
mbetme,gsa7c5l,"I actually purchased one of the first Tesla‚Äôs in 2016 based on the promise that Elon had made for the new FSD software and eventual Tesla network.  In 2019 I doubled down and bought a second with the idea that eventually I would have a mini fleet earning money in the network.  In 16 he promised it within 2 years, and in 19 within a year or so.  Now he is down to implying it will happen next month and reiterating it every month.  Meanwhile there are some fundamental issues that have never improved like camera blinding when driving directly into a rising or setting sun.  At this point I am about ready to contact attorneys myself."
mbetme,grxxu2l,"Put me in the category of ""I'm surprised it hasn't happened yet"".

We bought our M3 back in 2019 and bought FSD for 4000 I think it was. At that point in time, they were advertising Full self driving on city streets by the end of the year. It rolls around and.... Nothing. They kept that same statement on the site when ordering a car for a while. Then a few months into 2020 they change the wording to whatever it is now, autosteer on city streets or something. I'm a bit surprised that more noise wasn't made about it but I heard nothing.

That being said, I don't really regret buying it at all, we got it at a good price, it does have some pretty useful features that get used a lot. However, I don't know that I would buy it again with another tesla at this pricepoint unless it starts showing some crazy progress"
mbetme,gs7yyn5,"My guess is that the $10,000 is actually an upfront payment for a ""free"" hardware upgrade that will be required for it to actually work. I don't think the current hardware will ever actually provide FSD. There are rumors they are looking at an Israeli company that has a high definition radar system. I know Elon says they can do it without radar (or LIDAR), but it's much harder to do with only cameras. Why not do it the easy way with hi-res radar to supplement the cameras... Especially when you already have the money from customers to pay for the necessary upgrades. Not sure if other hardware would need to be upgraded, but at minimum I think radar will need to be improved and probably side and rear radar added as well.

As evidence, I point to their focus on self driving on City streets rather than on the highway. Other manufacturers including GM, Nissan, Honda, etc. have hands free on highway systems, but Tesla does not. The sonar sensors Tesla uses are great at low speeds, but virtually useless on the highway. I think that's why they are years behind other manufacturers when it comes to hands free driving on highways. They probably thought that one low resolution radar and cameras would be enough but can't make it work with existing hardware... If they could, they would already have a hands free mode like other manufacturers have for a while.

Just my thoughts. Interested to hear what others think."
mbetme,gs7gs8s,"Full Self Driving (level 5 autonomy) is. not. possible. on a Tesla with the current hardware. There is a reason ever single other autonomous company (Waymo, Cruise) uses a full range of LIDAR and other sensors that are just no on Teslas. Period. 

Tesla will never be full self-driving. You got scammed by Elon who is using yours, your occupants, and other innocent bystanders as a beta testers.   


Sorry, this is a scam."
mbetme,gs7ptzk,"Tbh I think the media cuts them major slack rn. Elon‚Äôs been tweeting FsD shit since 2016. Any other company would‚Äôve drowned in negative press if they failed to deliver purchases years after promised. 

I could def see previous buyers not returning to Tesla once competition emerges. Which it will. Give it 5 years."
mbetme,gscitgn,"I suggest that the claims since 2016 -- that the equivalent of level 5 autonomy was imminent (LA to NYC by end of 2017), and that the cars have all the necessary hardware -- is a false advertising liability even for buyers who did not purchase FSD. The optionality to buy FSD later added perceived value to cost-benefit equation of the car purchase."
mbetme,gsjg2jq,"When I bought FSD in 2020Q3 for $5000, based on CEO's representation at the time, I expected my car to drive itself on city streets by the end of 2020. This is the reason I originally bought the car for. 

The only feature I got, on top of the EAP that I previously had, was traffic light detection. This is not what I paid for.

While I have been overly positive about Tesla in the past, now I feel cheated and would like to have my money back."
mbetme,gs3y26i,"What will happen if FSD never works: Tesla will at some point recognize all FSD revenue, say that FSD is complete. There will be lots of complaints and angry emails and tweets to the SEC. Then Elon and Tesla will start selling ""full flying car package"", also known as ""FFCP""."
mbetme,gs4c9c5,"Didn't see any mention of the EU, which if I was betting, is where Elon could be at risk. Consumer protection law is much stronger there than our law."
mbetme,gs7ye3z,Same thing that happens to anyone who misleads people into spending money off of false promises.
mbetme,gsa0yu2,"I think that it's difficult to put prices on anything. I bought FSD when it still was a $6000 option for my Model 3 - and I live in Germany. I knew very well that I probably won't see FSD in Germany in the next 5 years (at least). Even if it is released in the US, German regulators will not allow it until either a). there is significant evidence that it works very well or b) one of the German car makers has something similar and pushes for it. 

I purchased FSD because it also gives you extra features and qualifies you for future hardware upgrades. If they find out that you need to change the cameras/computer or add hardware to make FSD work, well then they will retrofit that to my car. Just like they did with the Model S. 

You also get preferred treatment with software updates. 

I personally love my Tesla and am fine with funding FSD activity with my contribution and enjoy my incremental upgrades until then.

BUT I do agree that Tesla should be more realistic with their time lines. Stating robo-taxis will be around by ""the end of the year"" simply is not doable. They made significant progress with FSD, but driving without a person behind the wheel in unknown streets... no way. not within the next 3 years. My dream is that you can ""qualify"" a specific route for the Tesla, for example the way to work or to school. The car knows the route and all of its quirks, then I could send my car to pick up my daughter. Or take me to work. I hope that comes within 2 year (in the US at least). 

Also I believe that even FSD doesn't  sees the light of day within the next 5 years (also due to regulations) they for sure will enhance the driver assist features, and then maybe you don't have to nudge the wheel ever 30 seconds but only every 2 minutes (or not at all when you are on the highway). That itself would be worth a lot of money"
mbetme,gsglm5m,"I've been driving my Model 3 for almost 3 years and over 40,000 miles.  I purchased FSD for $2000 when it was on sale.  For all practical purposes, my car comes close to driving itself on my over 100 mile commute as well as in city streets.  It doesn't handle turns and has occasional lapses.  It requires monitoring just like commercial aircraft autopilots.  The current series of fatal aircraft crashes happened when pilots didn't quickly handle situations where autopilots failed or couldn't cope.  Several similar saves happened when experienced pilots took over.  I bet FSD will be the same for quite a while.  It will reduce accidents in many everyday situations but will require an alert  driver at the wheel monitoring the situation."
mbetme,gsjpl2y,Imagine if all the people who bought FSD instead spent the money on the stock!!
mbetme,gs00nxk,"You can tell when the lawyer makes a quality post :)  


All very good questions and very well put!

Personally I think Tesla should be on the hook to refund/transfer FSD (owners choice) to another car if you get rid of the car before FSD is delivered and out of ""beta""."
mbetme,gs0nxru,"I just really wish they would make it transferable or at least some discount.  In the 3 years that I've owned FSD I've gotten almost nothing out of it that wouldnt already be included in EAP, yet at this point I have gone from 0 kids to 2 soon so I wouldn't mind buying a Model Y, except it's 20% of the cars cost just to get the feature back."
mbetme,grxfrd1,"I don't think there's much exposure and I'll explain why. Tesla has never said (from what I've seen) that FSD = SAE defined Level 5. They make statements such as ""It will drive you from home to work"" and other descriptive but vague comments. 

Based on the YouTubes out there, we can see that in many circumstances, this is true. Is it true for every trip for every tester? No, but they never really commit to that. I don't see any contract per se - just this last weekend, I drove a 210 mile round trip. The car drove about 208 miles of it (I do have FSD but not the beta). That's pretty damn close to FSD. When I get the beta, it could have done the door-to-door. I'd call that FSD even though in the winter time with no lane markings, it wouldn't work. So they delivered on FSD even though it's not usable 100% of the time.

As for financial, if their auditors determine that FSD is not met, then they'll have an impaired asset and have to right down the value of the IP and write off some of their research costs.

But, because they never committed to a timeline or well-defined feature set nor executed a signed contract with customers specifically delineating all this, I don't think there's much risk. They can always say ""We're working on it and we plan to deliver it"". They do show continual progress so it's hard to argue with those statements."
mbetme,gs95jbn,I have had a Model S since 2014 so I get lots of inquires for purchase advice from friends and family.  The #1 rule is never ever pay for the ‚Äúfull self driving‚Äù up front. It‚Äôs a total fraud until it‚Äôs legal to use and it‚Äôs out of beta.  I feel bad for for everyone who got suckered in to paying up front.  If it ever materializes Tesla will gladly take your money to add it to your car later.
mbetme,gsg2wci,"Am I the only person who bought fsd and is willing to wait and not whine about a lawsuit?  It is what it is, nobody forced me to buy FSD."
mbetme,gsiun9h,"You are not allowed to book revenue of the product when you have not delivered a feature promised. So if Tesla is using the revenue of FSD and booking it in the current quarter and not delivering what they promised they could be in violation of **Sarbanes-Oxley act**. 

Apple learned this lesson the hard way. Apple now books iphone revenues over 24 months to allow for feature unlocking over the the duration. (it might be longer than 24 months)

It is not clear how Telsa books the revenue from their cars and is probably why they want to get to subscription model of charging for FSD which would get around this."
mbetme,gryo1bl,"If FSD never materializes then Tesla can remove any damages to a buyer by refunding the premium the buyer paid for the feature. I believe that Tesla has had to hold the FSD premium off their income statement because they have not yet delivered it (in fact, by delivering FSD they would be able to recognize a good deal of revenue that has been sitting on their balance sheet), so refunding the amount would not impact their income statement (but would be a cash hurt)."
mbetme,grxdtoy,"When you buy FSD, the purchase terms clearly note that no future or implied functionality is included and you‚Äôre only buying the features already out."
mbetme,grz8wjy,"If any EV competitor had anything even approaching the current state of FSD I‚Äôd peace out for my next vehicle.

But there isn‚Äôt."
mbetme,grzlmvy,"I believe Tesla will simply keep going on FSD, and never say "" thats it, its done"" As a software dev, Elon understands the job is never done, this sentence is the key "" As these self-driving features evolve, your car will be continuously upgraded through over-the-air software updates. "" 

There will never be a date where Tesla say, thats it, FSD is done and dusted."
mbetme,gs0p8i9,"Tesl holds legal liability regardless of what anyone says. Even if there is a disclosure when you purchase it saying they will try to deliver to the best of their abilities, The liability comes in the wording of the feature ‚Äúfull-self‚Äù driving. It implies a ‚Äúfull‚Äù sweat of self driving features. Legally it can be argued that any ‚Äúreasonable person‚Äù would consider ‚Äúfull self driving‚Äù as a promise of fully autonomous level 5 driving. Now that in itself would not be enough to be considered liability in court but he also routinely promoted the fact that Tesla drivers will have full self driving and is not very cautious in his wording of that fact. You can get into semantics of what he means but that doesn‚Äôt matter honestly. The burden in courts is to show what a ‚Äúreasonable person‚Äù would understand from his un cautious claims.

- Info came from my Business Liability profesor in Law School with 46 years of experience as a judge at the federal level."
mbetme,gs5hgqc,"When someone purchases FSD, Tesla adds that money to ‚Äòdeferred revenue‚Äô on their balance sheet.  This ‚Äòdeferred revenue‚Äô is counted as a ~~expense~~ liability.  As more FSD features are released, they slowly shift that ‚Äòdeferred revenue‚Äô into profits.  So if FSD is never released, they won‚Äôt take a hit on profits, they‚Äôll just take that portion of ‚Äòdeferred revenue‚Äô and give it back to customers.

Obv this won‚Äôt happen without a lawsuit as long as Tesla still believes they can deliver FSD."
mbetme,gryd8d1,"Even IF Tesla was exposed by their FSD promises, you do understand that it wouldn't be for nearly the value that you purchased FSD for, right? Everyone who has FsD has features that they otherwise would not have due to purchasing it. And even on the page where you buy it, it pretty much gives a list of features you will be getting. So let's say a class action law suit is brought forth. All Tesla would have to do is release The Current FSD Beta to all the customers who purchased FSD, and then they pretty much win. All you really need to do is check what portion of the FSD revenue they have counted. If they have counted 50% you know they believe they would be on the hook for 50% of the revenue in case of a lawsuit. However once they release FSD Beta to all FSD owners, they will likely recognize >90% of their FSD revenues because they will be confident even if they did lose a lawsuit it wouldn't be all that expensive."
mbetme,gryudma,My guess is this is a driving factor as to why they are moving FSD to subscription instead of a flat fee
mbetme,gs29i5q,"I agree It would help the program along much faster to include it for all drivers (maybe with clean records) to increase data collection. I also don't see how Tesla will be able to compete in the future with the added cost of FSD. Other manufacturers aren't charging for the tech they have. Once everyone has an FSD capability Tesla simply can't continue to charge 10k for the option. Buyers will look at other options. They'd certainly sell more cars now if it was included now, but I do understand they've got bills to pay."
mbetme,gsa4hf5,"Maybe I'm unique, but I specifically signed up to FSD for what it \*already\* had.  Of course I am excited about the future updates, but what you already get, as simple as Summons getting your car to drive itself out of your narrow overpacked garage or the ability to drive you on a winding mountain road with a center line are what I paid for.

Anything else is a welcome bonus. It was like buying the original iPhone in 2007: no cut & paste, no third party apps, etc. They all came to iOS later.  But even if none of these innovations had ever happened, that original iPhone was already, an amazing, priceless device."
mbetme,gsh1k42,"My delusions about how visionary Elon is have slowly evaporated over the years, but the final nail in their coffin was watching a movie I had never seen on its original release.  Total Recall was released when Elon was 9 or 10 and I am 100 percent convinced he has based his entire life quest on that rather low budget film."
mbetme,gry22vu,"They are going to release something that works well enough (not true full self driving but ""can self drive under right circumstances"") and that will be considered good enough. Of course they will continue to iterate but no guarantees about the feature actually working that great. The current betas seem to meet that criteria.

This is what they have been doing all along (Enhanced AutoPilot being an example). Even basic auto-pilot has issues with phantom braking. NOA is very reactive and doesn't have enough basic planning (in my experience, it will take a sharp curve at whatever I set the speed to and then slow down suddenly within the curve making for herky jerky driving). Smart summon etc...the list goes on.

We are in an age of perpetual beta"
mbetme,grxgmh3,"Not everyone has a litigious nature.

Tesla is in a unique position of creating a market in a capitalist economy. They are the market fo now, so they don't have to care. Tesla has not had to compete for the market. This explains the horrid customer communication, service and support. But, capitalism brings competition. It does not appear Tesla is prepared for a competitive environment as they appear to be doing little to correct any of the customer facing flaws. That arrogance will create a financial dilemma for the company in itself. 

All of this is to point to an undercurrent of distaste that has many waiting silently for the competitors to show up so they can jump the Tesla ship. Will they give away features (not right now as the GM version of autopilot has the same feature set as a Tesla). But those who jump the Tesla ship (rather than sue) will be jumping because of Tesla's complete lack of concern for the customer. 

As I've said before, the frontline Tesla employees are hamstrung by the same issues as customers - don't blame the employees."
mbetme,grxi72f,You'll get some good responses in r/teslainvestorsclub too.
mbetme,grzbq9c,[deleted]
mbetme,gs53yuj,"Your only paying for the computer capability and certain features it's capable of now 

Navigate on auto pilot which is basically stay in lane slow down speed up, auto lane change, auto park, summon, full self driving computer*, traffic light and stop sign control 

Auto steer on city streets says later this year that's the only thing they promise that it can't do now

When I put in my order I was reading it should be able to in the future know where you are going based on your calendar. So like if it's after you wake up and you go to work at a certain time you eventually will be able to get into the car and it will drive you to work you won't even have to say anything

[scroll down to FSD](https://www.tesla.com/autopilot)"
mbetme,gs932e5,"I see this like a Kickstarter.   Most of us bought FSD for less than the current price.  Each time new features come out, Elon has raised the price.

The FSD videos have been very impressive for the most part.  These are real Tesla owners posting them.   We don't have long to wait until April to see what reality looks like.

This is a tough problem.  It will work well in some situations and poorly in others.   But it is my belief and expectation that it will continue to improve much as Autopilot has.

Autopilot has changed my life.  I am so much safer on the highway with autopilot than without."
mbetme,gs0wsmt,1 relevant question: what's your purpose?
mbetme,grzpot4,"I won't comment on the legality, because I'm not a lawyer, but I will say it would be a damned shame if owners did this.

I bought FSD in May of 2018 fully aware that I may not own the car when the functionality I'm most excited about would be available. So I could not in good conscience pretend to be a victim. I understand some others may not have been this well informed when they did the same. HOWEVER...  and it's a big capitalized HOWEVER...

What you did get was freaking awesome and very cheap/inexpensive. What you got was the only possible way to buy a car in 2018 for which the manufacturer would attempt to upgrade to autonomous tech as soon as they can pull it off. What other car available from 2018 until now can offer that? Any other car maker would require you buy a whole NEW car when they finally pull off autonomy...

I enjoy getting updates and having my car get more and more FSD over time. It's incredibly fun... I feel like I've already gotten my money's worth...

Any class action that would ask me to join can go f themselves, ungrateful loons."
mbetme,grye53t,"1. There is no legal obligation to deliver anything more than what exists already. Plain and simple. 
2. Even if you think there is, the current FSD beta already fulfills the feature set for said obligation. If they are approved to roll it out, great. If not, they are covered. They always stated that FSD rollout depends on regulatory approval. 
3. There would be some small class action suits filed by salty customers that can‚Äôt do their research before making a purchase, or make decisions based on non-legally binding tweets instead of the actual description of said product.

Overall, it will hurt their bottom line and definitely tarnish reputation, but it won‚Äôt sink the company. But you gotta understand, they won‚Äôt ever come right out and say ‚ÄòSorry, FSD is not possible‚Äô. They will continue to work on it until the end of time if needed."
mbetme,grxkesl,"I wouldn't expect that it constitutes a breach of contract because nothing in the purchase agreement or FSD advertisement specifies exactly what they will achieve or when, other than driving you from A to B with ""no intervention by the person in the driver's seat."" That realistically sets the bar at Level 3ish by requiring a person in the driver's seat. 

As far as refunds, the portion of FSD revenue that would be owed to buyers for the undelivered features is still deferred and carried on Tesla's balance sheets as liabilities. So refunding those buyers a portion of the FSD price wouldn't negatively have much effect on the company's financials. It would just be more of a PR beating than anything."
mbetme,gs4y8s6,[deleted]
mbetme,grzkhbc,FSD already provides me quite a bit of value. Not sure what all this talk about FSD not existing is about. I use it all the time.
mbetme,gs2xfvy,"Personally, I would not be likely to join in a lawsuit unless there was some evidence that they sold it under false pretenses. Some might consider Elon‚Äôs comments and tweets to be false pretenses. I don‚Äôt. 

I purchased FSD as purely speculative. If I end up with nothing, well your rolls the dice and takes your chances. 

One thing I don‚Äôt see mentioned in the comments so far is about ‚ÄúFeature complete‚Äù.  If the car can drive itself on all roads but often requires intervention, that could be considered FSD  not on a level that would allow robo taxi but enough to consider them as having made good on their promises (As stated in the web site. It would be yet to be seen if Elon‚Äôs promises of robo taxi are legally binding. (And before anyone tries to tell me ‚Äúof course they are legally binding‚Äù, neither you, me, or anyone else, law degree or not, can say with absolute certainty what a court may eventually rule. ))"
mbetme,grz39xo,"The last feature to deliver is steering on city streets.  They just have to get it to the point that it is safe enough to release to the masses.  It doesn‚Äôt need to be great or work everywhere.

If Tesla turned 100% of their focus to just either making high confidence turns or tell the driver to take over they can likely be done in a month.

I rate their exposure very low now.  A year ago I was worried that they might be subjected to legal action, but I no longer have that concern."
mbetme,gryis5t,"Compare what Tesla has to what other carmakers have.   There's no comparison.

Whether it's ""late"" or not is irrelevant.   It's first by a mile."

mbetme,gs8fqx3,Y‚Äôall been duped again
mbetme,gs8p2ai,"Its impossible to achieve level 5 autonomy with just cameras. Tesla might achieve level 5 with lidar+camera but then they will have to chew the poison pill that Musk tweeted about lidar being worthless.
GM/google/intel solutions are truely moving towards level5 with lidar+camera while tesla will be stuck at most to level3.
They might come back and ask more money to install upgraded hardware or possibly wait until lidars become cheap enough & small enough that current $10k covers the cost."
mbetme,gs8tj73,"This is an interesting discussion.

I tried to catch up with a lot of comments, but one distinction I haven't seen:

* Promises to shareholders *vs*
* Promises to customers

From the website, I do get the impression that FSD means that car drives itself, yet it's not clear if I that's unattended, allowing me to sleep. From Tweets and communication to shareholders, it seems that the goals were more ambitious (you *can* sleep while it drives itself by end of 2020). I think litigation from customers and shareholders might be really two different animals, if it comes to that."
mbetme,gs8xc87,When I paid for FDS it was my understanding that it may not happen at all. But I also new that it would give me some advance driving assistance that I think it was worth the cost and it keeps getting better...
mbetme,gs9isa0,Lay men not person. Go back to Twitter.
mbetme,gs9lrld,so that original contract is from the yr tsla burned 3 general counsels? huh
mbetme,gs9va86,"Just to clarify this in advance: I'm traveling in a Tesla Model 3 on European roads and am an early adopter (at least in Europe 3/2019 was one of the first months to get a m3) also of FSD. This also means besides several regulatory restrictions (nagging) I'm still on HW 2.5 (cause Tesla did not upgrade that though promissong so in Germany by now - which upsets me a litttle bit) which gives me some other restrictions (red lights, speed limit recognition).

One year before I bought my Tesla m3, I had a Easter weekend to try out the latest greatest BMW Hybrid (I was a BMW Driver those days and they gave it to me for free from Thursday to Tuesday to go anywhere I want). That one was equiped with everything BMW had as a driver assistant system those days. The system comparable to the Tesla ""aurtopilot/FSD"" worked fine on German motorways and in traffic jam. It did not work well as soon as we crossed the German border on motorways anymore nor did it work at all on city-streets or in rural areas.

So here's the conclusion of all that:

When riding my Tesla today I'm using Autopilot on more than 90% of my trips distance (yes there are necessary interventions, but more than 90% of the miles I drive  - in cirties, rural roads and motorwways) are driven by the AUTOPILOT system without intervention. This makes my traveling safer, more secure and leaves me ¬¥(much !) less tired at my destination. Though the only damages on the car also have been caused by me using autopilot too overoptimistic (one scratch on the left fender when backing out from a parking lot on summon, two rims damaged in a narrow city street.)

So I believe the thing I've gotten when buying FSD back in 3/2019 is more than worth the over 5.000 EUR I paid for it at that time - at least compared to the prices of other less capable systems already on the market.

After all, as far as I know as a shareholder Tesla has abot more than 1.5 billion USD of deferred revenue (revenue, they did not count as already achieved) in their balance sheet, because they not yet did want to bet on FSD. So I think this is the least and best at the same time they could do for me as a shareholder.

On the other hand if listening to Andres podcast theses days I heard Teslas FSD AI incorporates ""only"" 60 Million ""parameters"" by today. Where we all heard about the OPEN AI GPT-2 NN going to get autonomous far over what it was produced to do on 1.5 Billion parameters in 2019. So the breakthrough for the TESLA AI might be somewhat further in the future, when Dojo is putting in new parameters into the NN on lightspeed at the end of 2021. That's what I expect.

This systems do not develop linear but exponential. And coming from what I can do today on my HW2.5 car, to seeing what people can do on their HW3 cars with FSD Beta, I'm still very optimistic that if anyone solves FSD (Level-5) it will be Tesla. Because on AI you have to remember what my teacher always told me: ""it's the data stupid""! And no other company on the world has more data to train an AI on traffic situations worldwide than Tesla.  


Update 1:  


As I read a lot about some of you are about going to file a class action suit let me state this:  


1st European customers will not be able to join in on that in the US

2nd European legislation does only give a very limited chance to file class action suits at all

3rd I would however not join any lawsuit on this matter at all, because this matter (delievery of potentially ""incomplete"" software) is very new to the judges and I would expect a lot of diferent rulings on the way through the judicial bodies, where in the end you might get a judgement after years at a time when Tesla is ready to deliver Level-5 autonomy."
mbetme,gsa22i7,"I am bullish on Tesla long-term and bearish on full self driving anytime in the near future by Tesla or any company.

That said I agree with Tesla‚Äòs head of AI that a vision-based solution that does not require pre-mapping your route in a Geo fenced area is the best long-term play and to my knowledge Tesla is the only company working on that solution."
mbetme,gsa4dou,"I think that Tesla has helped with making the road safer with some of these tech features, but I don't see FSD happening."
mbetme,gsa4pl8,I‚Äôm still wondering why the people who threw 250k down for the ‚Äúroadster‚Äù aren‚Äôt more pissed off
mbetme,gsaaty1,"https://twitter.com/trak0r/status/1374367510431162369?s=19

Still no reply of course. 

Elon is a snake oil salesman, FSD is his oil."
mbetme,gsao5f9,"Couldn't agree more, but I have a feeling their lawyers tried doing everything to protect themselves against this in the fine print.

Elon claimed car would get better and be worth more. Just checked my Tesla trade in value, and it's 60% of purchase price 2 years later. Plus I've lost range, lost premium connectivity feature that now costs $10/month, very few fsd ap3 improvements, and lost out on free charging because I bought a month early. Do you see why I'm bitter now? Haha.

Still love my MX, I just don't know how FSD can happen with cameras that can't drive into suns glare or see through snow."
mbetme,gsaw26w,"On a personal level there's also the issue of the optics of it all and how that impacts potential purchases. 

FSD has done nothing but get pushed further and further back, and with a not-insignificant price increase to boot. It was never 'cheap' to begin with but at $10,000 it's now more expensive than just about anything on a Porsche option sheet and that's really saying something.

More to the point about Tesla's exposure, in my case - soon to pull the trigger on a Y or refreshed S - I simply will not pay $10k for FSD given how it's all gone to date. I cannot be the only one making the decision from this POV."

mbetme,gsqdtjs,Tesla has built the best ADAS and the worst AV system at the same time.
mbetme,gtgrbbk,"Big surprise. **Elon oversold FSD.** He doesn't understand machine learning nearly as well as he does rockets. He thinks, *""Throw in a bunch of data and then it will be magical!""* (xkcd has a nice comic on this). There isn't a clear proof that pure vision is more advantageous than LiDAR (or vice versa).

**SpaceX will land humans on Mars before Tesla achieves level 5 autonomy**. We just don't have a way to achieve L5 autonomy right now. You can't treat vehicles/pedestrians or other road elements as probabilistic agents that are accurately predictable and say *""Current ML models will work!""*.

The average consumer thinks technology will automatically improve. But neural networks are terribly inconsistent. Tesla's data engine and fleet management is an extraordinary achievement but it is not at all capable of achieving L5 autonomy (and neither are Waymo, Cruise etc).

**This is not something that Tesla should've treated as a serious consumer product in the first place.** They should've given it an **experimental** label and the honest answer which is, *""You can buy the FSD option because at some point (we don't know when - it maybe half a decade or a decade), all Tesla vehicles* ***may*** *be able to drive themselves.* ***Tesla isn't responsible for the owner's decision to trust wild claims made by our CEO***"" or something along those lines.

Elon will piss a lot of people because of FSD.

**Here are my conclusions:**

1. Elon is a risk taker and therefore he decided to oversell FSD which he shouldn't have done.
2. Tesla's highway auto-pilot system is clearly useful to many people. This is not the case with FSD beta. **Tesla shouldn't have called it ""beta"" in the first place because it's based on the assumption that FSD is feasible in the timeframe that Elon purports and it will soon no longer be ""beta"".** FSD beta will be ""beta"" for a LONG time.
3. Tesla shouldn't have been so bullish in claiming FSD's capability or arrival date. They should've given the honest statement that **FSD will take a long time to mature, that nobody can predict when L4/L5 autonomy is going to come,** that the car will continue to improve in capability but the system should be given the ""experimental"" tag and **if the customer isn't satisfied, they'll be refunded.**
4. The issue can be resolved if Tesla simply refunded a large portion of payments made by owners."
mbetme,h0hoi18,Could it be that Tesla increases price simply because they DO NOT want people to buy FSD just yet? They got plenty of beta testers and just don't need any more.
mbetme,h5riaf6,"I pre-ordered my Tesla in late April, it was built in May, and I picked it up in early June. 

Why is that important? I ordered the FSD when it was a combination radar/camera. But in May, they removed the radar part and went all camera, or Tesla Vision, as they call it. 

Well, it's a piece of crap. For instance, in adaptive cruise control, the software has difficulty judging distances and doesn't follow at the selected distance regardless of the weather. 

The autopark hasn't worked since the day I got it (yes, I read the manual and watched videos). I also get a lot of collision warnings (loud beep) that are false alarms. 

These are all related to the new Tesla Vision. I have a service call coming up to look at these issues and more, but I don't think they can fix programming issues. We'll see. 

I would like to have the FSD removed, and my money refunded, because this isn't the FSD I thought I was getting. But I know... Fat chance."
mbetme,haeu28s,Tesla should be investigated for fraud for misleading the public given its past statements around the promises of full automation without driver engagement.  They‚Äôve been saying things like the car will drive itself without the driver having to do anything but get in the vehicle. This has been proven demonstrably false and it‚Äôs aim has been to increase sales and pump up its stock.  If someone had sold an elixir that promises a medical or health benefit and then hedges on those claims by promising that it will come soon but not delivered for who knows how long then that company should be investigated for fraud.  At some point the cars and it‚Äôs owner May no longer exist because Tesla keeps pushing the date of availability for these features to an end date that doesn‚Äôt exist.

But for a regular person $10k is a lot for something that is not done yet. However I think it is very very low chance of them not delivering, I can see another two year delay for the neural network to learn weird interaction in different places. But for example New England I think will be the worst in the US. Some grid areas will be super easy."

Does the tweet rise to a legal standing of fact to allow it to breach the button language idk. I opted out of going to law school.  I am however sure there are some ruthless lawyers looking for a buck who will take a hard look at this.  


The worst part is it feeds the Tesla faithful it‚Äôs just one more hop away and those who doubt are not true believers, yet Tesla misses the target over and over.  


This also feeds the fud machine to expound on the failures and broken promises as a marketing angle.  This is just a self inflicted wound.  


Then the last folks the one who will sue, and they are converts from camp 1 who have had enough.  They were your recommendation machine and now are working against you.  



The easy solution is leave the button.  Make no promises.  And delivery more iterative updates silently.  That however does not make the Tesla bull stock mob happy so here we are.

The advertising at the very least would have required disclaimers in fine print legal \*Coca Cola's cancer curing capabilities are not approved by the FDA and may not gain certification pending clinical trials.

Tesla absolutely has to deliver or refund or face a lawsuit.  Perpetually delaying delivery also is impossible.  If it were legally possible to defraud people by saying ""well I just haven't delivered yet!"" then every con man on earth would be in the clear.

mbetme,gs4bigy,There is that regulatory lie again. In the US there is no federal regulations for autonomous vehicles.  Cringe every time Elon trots that out because it‚Äôs obviously an attempt to put the onus on the government rather than the fact Tesla is selling vapor ware

mbetme,gs4u3uq,"Two cents from someone who has been more critical of Tesla than most here.

First, I agree with the sentiment of OPs post.  But, really, this quote above is the end of the discussion. 

Tesla will almost certainly win any lawsuits that are filed. And with the current conservative lean on US courts, which more often than not rule in favor of corporations, I find it very difficult to see them losing even a marginal case. At the end of the day, Tesla is selling a work-in-progress to the final goal. The topic, ‚Äúwhat if that goal doesn‚Äôt happen?‚Äù isn‚Äôt relevant because as long as Tesla is working toward it- which is to say, as long as Tesla exists- then they‚Äôre keeping their end of the promise. 

Tesla has even less investor liability. The American middle class has no more business day trading or even attempting to run professional valuations and trade books than arguing cases in court or performing surgeries. But they do it anyway. And millions reaped rewards when it went well for them. 

If it goes south they have to own that too. When you invest in a company you are responsible for doing your due diligence. Nothing is guaranteed. In the end, if asked, Elon will predictably claim he has not lied. Timelines are always expectations. He can‚Äôt see the future. 

The fact that large swath of TSLA investors changed their mind on how hard FSD would really be is irrelevant. And the narrative that Tesla should suddenly get punished and investors compensated, just because people feel that way, is anti capitalist and anti markets. After all, what would you say to people who formed a thesis against Tesla years ago on the basis of FSD being harder than advertised? They got smoked out of their positions and many here made money on them. 

I know it‚Äôs unpopular to say but you can‚Äôt wake up one day and doubt something that has been debated for a long time and expect to be compensated. This is the risk of the market. Especially with a company like Tesla. If you don‚Äôt like it and you‚Äôre an ‚Äúinvestor‚Äù, close your position.

As far as the fall out from a court battle goes, maybe it would hurt Tesla.. maybe not. Surely everyone here knows the story. Anyone who goes to war with Tesla knows that they will be subject to endless attacks on Twitter, here on Reddit etc. They may be doxxed, their families may be attacked, and it‚Äôs even possible that Elon attacks them personally. None of this is new. 

So yeah, it‚Äôs possible it hurts Tesla, but also it‚Äôs possible that the people making claims somehow never get any ‚Äúgood faith‚Äù warranty coverage, always find themselves at the back of lines, and that the most famous among them have damaging PII leaked - information that may or may not be true. And again, none of that would be new.

At the end of the day, if you are a Tesla fan I think you should have faith that the company will be fine and rest assured Tesla is working on it."
mbetme,gry37iv,"I agree that time is running out for FSD to deliver on the promise of a level automation that is significantly better than what was initially released at the very least.  Tesla aimed very high with FSD by choosing to make it a general solution to driving without geofencing or other more narrowly focused solutions. However, I see a tipping point for Tesla either to have a breakthrough or get into trouble with owners/lawsuit in the next couple years."
mbetme,gs3e6zh,"I know that engineers are specifically advised *not* to use broad disclaimers when entering into contracts. Disclaimers such as, ""you are responsible if I fail to deliver my work"", or ""I cannot be held responsible if my work is shoddy"", are specific examples of unenforceable disclaimers in engineering. 

Now I don't know if the same principles will apply in Tesla's case (IANAL), but if they do, I'd wager that things wouldn't go very well for Tesla in a court case."

mbetme,grxfqu7,Don't hold your breath.
mbetme,grxjh1c,"Yeah, I'm not going to buy FSD until and unless the features currently available justify the entire cost. For me personally, I don't think I'd pay $10k for anything short of Level 4, and I don't see that happening any time soon."
mbetme,gry00zt,[deleted]
mbetme,gs0kyw8,"I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about this.  I bought my model 3 in 2019 when FSD was a $5k option.  That seemed like a reasonable amount to pay for a bet on FSD. 

But here is my dilemma. I am seriously considering trading in my Model 3 for a new Model S and I am  having a hard time wrapping my arms around a $10k option for a feature set that I personally don‚Äôt think will ever approach level 3 autonomy. 

That said, I love playing with the ‚ÄúFSD‚Äù updates and am looking forward to playing with the new beta.  


The quandary:  Is it worth paying over 12% of the purchase price of the new Model S for some unbaked toys - even if they are fun? 

And then I keep thinking I would really be out $15k (my original $5k and the new $10k).  Tesla is ascribing no value to FSD on my trade-in offer.  

Not sure what I am going to do.  It‚Äôs a close call."
mbetme,gsesy5m,">I hope they allow transfers,

I wonder how many people are still hoping for this, even after the CEO directly said they won't do it."
mbetme,gs7ciob,"I agree partially. However, Tesla's assets are currently $25.6B and they carry a 0.9 debt to asset ratio, meaning they really only have about $2.5B in tangible equity and cash. Their profit last year (the most profitable ever) was about $750M. If the exposure what what you calculated, it would still be two years profits and the bulk of their hard earned equity. The fallout would no doubt push their debt to asset ratio above 1 again, which is the point where you are upside down. The financial hit along side the reputation (and probably sales) hit would be devastating."
mbetme,gs8lmi6,"I disagree with 50% assessment. The promise made was L5 autonomy, not L2 ADAS. The current FDS Beta is still L2. When NoA reaches L3 on freeway, I'll agree to give 10-20%. As of the current FSD Beta, I'd say it's 0%."
mbetme,gsrxf6k,Do you at this point believe your cars will eventually earn money without a driver?
mbetme,gssuhnj,"In the beginning I was about 90 percent confident they will.  Now based on the sticky issues I am aware of that are unresolved despite multiple software updates and plenty of driver overrides for the supposed ‚Äúlearning‚Äù to take effect, I am below 50 percent confident.  Probably more like 25 % just based on the fact that the blinding issue does not seem to be solvable without significant hardware changes.  My guess is they will make another hardware change to achieve it, and instead of retrofitting all the cars that were sold with FSD they will offer a lame discount of some type."
mbetme,gsevvkq,">Put me in the category of ""I'm surprised it hasn't happened yet"".

mbetme,gsl82rt,"Thank you for your response. I think your position is common and I have no interest in shouting down my fellow redditors. However, i think what we are hoping to understand is how the failure to meet customer expectations is going to impact the company. I have no doubt that there has been significant brand damage because of the delays. However, there is a large contingent of ownership that does not see anything wrong with what is going on. Thus far regulators have done little more than sniff around to see what the foul odor is.

I am an owner. Like you, I did not purchase at the current full price. However, I did pay a substantial amount of money and made that decision based on the public statements of the CEO. I pulled the trigger because Elon expressed confidence in features and timelines with a high degree of specificity. I acknowledge that the wording of the contracts are designed to limit exposure. However, I also feel that the incongruity is intentional, and therefore legally questionable.

I hold on to hope that the promises made will be kept and in short order. However, I don't think this will have any chance of happening if significant pressure doesn't come to bare on Tesla. There are far too many technical, financial, and regulatory pressures to drag this out for as long as possible before admitting defeat.

For this to be successful, Tesla needs to stop playing the ""ask forgiveness instead of permission"" game with customers and regulators and instead put together a clear public strategy to move this forward quickly, safely, and legally."

mbetme,gsjy5y7,"I think part of the valid discussion is that if people had done that, it would have had two contradictory impacts. First, the additional demand for the stock would have driven it upwards. Second, the reduced revenue and profits would have had a negative impact of some sort (theoretically). Where that equilibrium would have been found is a matter of some level of voodoo. 

For me, the interesting ethical question is if insiders pimped FSD driving up value and then cashed out during that time period. The answer is unfortunately that they did. Elon's brother sold $25M in stock in early Feb while Elon was pushing the FSD Beta progress hard. The timing is suspect given that he should have known at that point the real status of the release and almost certainly had knowledge of the general counsel's e-mails to Cal DMV that had not yet been made public through a records release. The timing isn't really proof of anything, but it looks bad.

(Edited to correction for Elon's brother, not Elon himself on the sale)."
mbetme,gt5k6b2,"Totally agree.  I'm a very early M3 customer (ordered on day after reveal), and I actually shelled out for FSD at launch, and further shelled out for the computer upgrade - so I think I'm $5K in.  I love the kickstarter analogy and critique above - that is an excellent way to think about it.  I'm not unhappy with my decision, and I am not too upset about the waiting for Godot situation.  This shit is hard and risky, so I don't get too bummed out by the delays.  Yes, kinda vaporware, but it's fascinating to see the tech evolve and I'm happy to be a part of it.  I realized it was a speculative cost when I went for it.  HOWEVER, once I learned that the features will be disabled when I sell the car - THAT is bullshit.  I work from home, the car barely gets driven.  So I really don't need the FSD too much. The fact that I can't resell with FSD and all of that really infuriates me.  I know other automakers are dying to do this same tactic as well - software enabled features that are tied to an owner, not a vehicle - and I hate that.  It's so anti-customer and a nakedly greedy revenue grab to get paid twice (or 3X or 4X for multiple resales) for the same thing. I would NEVER have paid for these features had I paid attention and realized that they stay with the owner, not the car.  I've spent \~$50K on this car, but I'll only be able to resell it as if it was a $40K car."
mbetme,grzawro,"Except of course Elon has talked up Level 5 abilities many times, starting in 2016.

Now they did not say ""Tesla FSD ^(TM)"" is going to be level 5. But it's not a stretch to see that robotaxies were a claim to be delivered to people who had purchased FSD, and they are going to be level 5. Blatantly obvious and deliberate implication there."
mbetme,gs39ryv,"> Based on the YouTubes out there, we can see that in many circumstances, this is true. Is it true for every trip for every tester? No, but they never really commit to that. I don't see any contract per se - just this last weekend, I drove a 210 mile round trip. The car drove about 208 miles of it (I do have FSD but not the beta). That's pretty damn close to FSD. When I get the beta, it could have done the door-to-door. I'd call that FSD even though in the winter time with no lane markings, it wouldn't work. So they delivered on FSD even though it's not usable 100% of the time.

That's a nonstarter. ""Full self driving"" implies a level of automation that Tesla has not shown to be capable of anything close to yet. If this went to court it would be the court's job to determine what ""full self driving"" means, exactly, and they would be deciding what a person could reasonably expect it to mean. 

To figure it out, they would include Tesla's marketing and Elon's statements as well as just looking at what the word ""full"" means and what ""self driving"" could be reasonably construed to mean.

The SAE definitions would have little impact precisely because Tesla has never linked their marketing to those definitions."

Some of the responders here believe they are recognizing at least some of the revenue as profit and more as time goes on, but the exact figures and methodology isn't known because DR of various types is reported lumped together in the annual report figures.

In a traditional case, say an annual contract or the construction of a physical piece of equipment/property, the the portion of the funds moved is accordance to a schedule defined by consistent fractional deliveries or by milestones. In this case, the company has never defined what ""complete"" is, nor have they firmly committed contractually to a completion date. Furthermore, the official company line is that they have no future obligation to you at all (which in itself is a weird admission that they can't book the revenue as unearned, but also that they don't owe anything)."
mbetme,gryp0wd,"Can you document that? Something like that has been asserted by other responders but it is unclear what the specifics are. I know that I carry liabilities against my income for accrual tax purposes, but that doesn't mean the funds are actually there. I don't have any solid numbers in terms of dollars collected or balance sheets. I'm not sure if that level of detail is public knowledge."
mbetme,gs3z63i,Tesla has already recognized lots of FSD revenue (more than half of it) when delivering small improvements like Summon for example.
mbetme,grxq4bz,"This has not always been the case. It was not the case when I purchased. Additionally, when marketing documents and the CEO is out saying otherwise, contract or no, there is exposure. We've already seen this in foreign geographies with European courts demanding that they adjust marketing materials and offer refunds for deceptive marketing related to FSD/AP. What I'm trying to figure out is what the level of that exposure is in the USA and globally."
mbetme,gs7qlu1,So how do you address EAP upgraders. They paid the upgrade price for nothing? All the features out during the upgrade period were already promised on EAP.
mbetme,gs8tqto,Take a look at Lucid Air. It will come with redundant system from power supply all the way to more than 2x sensors than Tesla's so that it can be upgraded to L3 in future.
mbetme,gs1dm9d,"Prepare to peace out to the next vehicle. While Elon has been distorting reality, folks have been hard at work. Ford, for instance, is a pretty conservative company - they've thrown out there that they'll have an FSD competitor in market, potentially this calendar year, with a price tag of $600. Although I find this difficult to believe, it would be very un-ford-like for such a statement to be completely untrue."
mbetme,gsdnp15,"I mean the etron has the good parts of FSD (staying between the lines, handling stop and go traffic, highway driving, etc) and is a much nicer car than any Tesla I‚Äôve been in"
mbetme,gs0ash7,"We can of course pit this against the typical  lifespan of a car, say five years. If someone buys a car and never gets access to FSD, then it doesn't matter if the job is never done because for that particular vehicle the job WAS never done. And Tesla is liable to make that right with either a refund or the ability to move FSD forward."
mbetme,gs90yk2,"I agree. Elon doesn't strike me as the type that would admit defeat easily either. I don't think he's a scam artist, just  unrealistic.  I don't think he will stop until he's satisfied or it becomes a problem financially, and then he can  blame it on regulations or lawyers.

Most geniuses  are always looking to expand boundaries and push limits. It's up to the consumer to determine how far they are willing to go along for the ride."
mbetme,gs63o0g,"Deferred revenue is a liability, not an expense"
mbetme,gs64uy8,"That general part is fairly well established. However, I think the pertinent part of that from a legal and financial perspective would be the mechanism Tesla is using to recognize the deferred revenue. To be in compliance with GAAP, there would need to be a disclosure outlining not just how much has been recognized, but the methodology Tesla is using to justify it.   


I'm going to get a little philosophical and out over my skis in terms of my GAAP/SEC rules understanding (I'm not an auditor), but in the case of a software system like this, there would need exist some sort of criteria established when they first started collecting deferred revenue that says how they will measure completion. I've been unable to find that disclosure but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist (The 2020 annual report is 300+ pages WITHOUT the supporting documents).   


Others in the thread have asserted that the methodology being used is 50% upon receipt and 50% upon delivery of a completed product. I've seen no proof of that methodology and, logically, there would need to be something outlining in at least general terms what ""complete"" means.  


Likewise, if this project is being run with even a tiny bit of sanity, Tesla is following some sort of well known project management methodology. Step 1 of nearly every such management system is to clearly and as specifically as possible define the goals and end state of the product.   


Elon has repeatedly tossed out dates for delivery, but he has also thrown out dates for the software being ""feature complete"". That term is widely recognized in the software development field as meaning the software does EVERYTHING it is supposed to do in the final release at some level of proficiency (usually not an acceptable one yet).   


My point of this is simply to say that regardless of what external people speculate, Tesla does or should have a pretty good idea of where FSD development stands relative to both the accounting metrics and the project management timelines. If what Elon has been saying publicly doesn't align with those internal metrics, the legal implications could be massive. However, again, not from a customer perspective, but from an inventor and regulatory perspective."
mbetme,grydxvl,"Can you cite case law that backs this up? I'm not saying you are wrong, but I'm skeptical that what they have done in the accounting system has any real bearing on dollar value of their legal liability. The percentage of value actually provided would become a matter of the court, not the IRS/CPAs."
mbetme,gs3a274,"> Even IF Tesla was exposed by their FSD promises, you do understand that it wouldn't be for nearly the value that you purchased FSD for, right? Everyone who has FsD has features that they otherwise would not have due to purchasing it. And even on the page where you buy it, it pretty much gives a list of features you will be getting. So let's say a class action law suit is brought forth. All Tesla would have to do is release The Current FSD Beta to all the customers who purchased FSD, and then they pretty much win.

No.  

Tesla's own page still says ""no action required by the person in the driver‚Äôs seat.""

Paying attention and having to keep your hand on the wheel are actions."
mbetme,gsasqus,"I think a lot of people agree with you. However, there is a large subset of the ownership community that doesn't feel that way. They bought on future promises regardless of what the contract said. I think it is a fairly supportable assertion to declare that the large number of presales and the fact that it was a separate line item to being with, was predicated on genuine consumer belief that the promises would be delivered as described in the media and in or near the timeline discussed."
mbetme,gsaipow,"Did the original iphone advertise copy+paste or third party apps?

I can see that it makes you safer if you are easily distracted by your phone, or you are under the influence."
mbetme,gs9kt5q,"You've hit the nail on the head.

The right way to look at FSD is, does it result in more lives saved and less crash injuries? 

If statistics show a clear improvement over not using it, then it's a success.

Like a vaccine. We don't sue drug companies because their coronovirus vaccines aren't 100pc effective in all circumstances."
mbetme,gs1umho,"The discussion of FSD status, timeframe, and if progress is reasonable has been had many times here and other places. I find that it usually devolves into a shouting match between the two groups well represented here, that being the mass of people who border on Elon worshipers and those that feel wronged/misled by him. I experienced something very similar to that in a FB thread for my local Tesla owner's group only two days ago.

I am trying to engage in a more thoughtful evaluation of what is going on from a non-technical perspective. In particular, I'm trying to make a determination in my own mind if what is going on here is reasonable and justifiable or if there is something nefarious afoot. It is easy to make accusations or draw conclusions based on preconceived biases about this. I'm hoping to be more factual about it.

Let me explain what I mean. The face-value explanation of all of this, and what the diehard fans will shout nay-sayers down with is, that this is a simple case of the solution being very hard to deliver in an environment where the consequences of mistakes could cost lives. Additionally, Elon is a starry-eyed dreamer that lacks the understanding or business sense to know that the promises he is making and the timelines he's promising them are just impossible bloviations that he shouldn't be spouting. No one should take them seriously.

On the far other end of the spectrum however (and you might want to put your tin hat on for this part) is another potentially defensible conclusion. Tesla has historically not been a profitable company being on the verge of insolvency at various times in its growth. When it has been profitable, those profits have often been buoyed by revenue streams unrelated or only tangentially related to auto manufacturing and much of those streams such as carbon credit sales will be rapidly diminishing over the next few years. It is also on a rapid growth trajectory trying to cement its hold in the auto manufacturing market before entrenched competitors catch up to its technical lead and growing its way out of debt trouble.

All of this means that Tesla desperately needs cash to stay afloat and feed the massive capital expenses of building several new manufacturing plants around the globe without exploding its debt ratio again (currently about 0.9, but historically as high as 4+. Current US average is about 0.72).

Last year Tesla did sales of roughly 500k vehicles. By numbers collected here, presold about 20% of those vehicles with FSD. Because I don't have actual figures and because the cost of FSD ramped from $7000 to $10000 in that year, it is hard to know with good precision that total dollars collected, but let's just say the average amount was $8000. That means that Tesla collected $800M in FSD presales last year against a full year profit of $721M without delivering a single unit of it. It isn't entirely clear to me if that $721M profit is inclusive or exclusive of the $800M based on the way it has been suggested it carries that money on its books. I suspect that it is exclusive (meaning cash profits including the FSD presales might have actually been $1.521B). Regardless, the FSD presales is an enormous part of its revenue stream and disrupting it would be disastrous.

I postulate that Elon is a bit of a wide-eyed child with extraordinary means that runs his mouth carelessly from time to time. However, I have a hard time accepting that he is an idiot savant who has grown his businesses in these industries but doesn't understand that his words move product and markets. What he is doing and saying has deliberate intent far more considered than the huffy machinations he comes up with between puffs of a fat blunt.

So roll up some tinfoil, stand on your head, and squint. You can pretty easily draw the conclusion that what we have here is the head of a major government subcontractor (SpaceX) deliberately and with seeming impunity (SEC not withstanding), using his social media platform and other public comments (and a little of Tesla marketing) to manipulate sales and stock value to keep an otherwise iffy business afloat (and get obscenely wealthy in the process) by gaslighting the public on FSD in the hopes of growing himself out of trouble and maybe, just maybe delivering enough of the FSD features someday to keep the pitchforks and torches off the front lawn in Fremont.

If that is true (and let me be clear that I have ZERO proof of any of this) it would be a scandal that I likened to Enron or Solyndra (ironically Tesla now occupies the former Solyndra space in Fremont) but others here have compared it to Theranos, and specifically in the FSD space, there is an argument to be made except that I don't believe it is ALL smoke and mirrors. If you read the UofNM report in the Journal of Business Ethics about Ken Lay what you quickly start to see is that Ken Lay was NOT the monster he was made out to be. He was undermined and caught off guard by underlings jocking to protect their own interests while frantically trying to keep the crew on the ship to bail water rather than abandonning it to sink. My personal belief is that this analogy is probably the most accurate if there is malfesence going on here.

What is really going on? I have no idea. Do I think this is a house of cards about to collapse throwing the auto manufacturing market and US economy into chaos and making shortsellers rich? No. Do I think it is more complicated and less wholesome than what is being sold? Absolutely. Where in that spectrum, I can't say. That's what I want to know and am poking around to inform myself about."

mbetme,gryh2bh,"This seems to be a common belief, but I'm not certain it is legally valid or realistic. As stated by others and with the hindsight of existing foreign litigation already restricting what they can claim, the existing contract probably does not provide blanket immunity, nor does it give them an indefinite timeline.   


If you'd like to assert one way or the other, I'd love to have actual caselaw referenced (that is point of this thread, to get to the actual law and financial exposure, not just make this about if you feel what is going on is reasonable or not).

mbetme,gs56quv,"Thank you. Your perspective is a common one among people who are happy with Tesla/Elon. Where I think the opinion runs afoul of other's (and you are NOT alone in this) is that the purchase agreement and the marketing are so profoundly in conflict as to create massive market confusion. Worse, that market confusion appears to be deliberate. How this would come down legally is a matter of debate here and other places. However, there is no doubt that a LARGE portion of the owners of FSD bought it with expectations at that time or created since that the product would be further along than it is currently. I have no doubt that there will be legal action attempted in the near future based on the negative current that has been building. That is really not something I want to see or encourage. However, I do believe there is something far worse in store for Tesla, and that is negative market reaction. Legally culpable or not, unhappy customers and now competitors are openly and defensibly calling Tesla's offering some sort of meretricious fugazi. Without rapid and immediate releases proving otherwise, this will continue and build. My belief is that the greatest legal risk here is not from customers, but rather from shareholders or the SEC who could hold Elon personally responsible should the stock collapse in some significant way as a direct or indirect result of FSD delays."

Putting the cart before the horse, wouldn't you say? 

Wouldn't you want the interior to NOT be minimalistic, seeing as you'll just be sitting there? The interior should cater to the owner's interest.

mbetme,gs05j64,"There is some confusion on this point. Tesla differentiates between FSD (Full Self Driving) and AP (AutoPilot). There has been some variation in these terms and how they applied, but MOST of the features that people currently use such as the adaptive cruise control and autosteer on the highway are actually part of the AP software not FSD. One could argue that AP and FSD are the same thing, albeit AP is crippled. This would be true in practice and also technically since there is no evidence that the computer actually functions any different for the different feature sets. It just chooses to not change lanes or follow routes even though it is probably evaluating and silently planning them in the background.

Where this debate gets hairy for people is that there is a WIDE variation in what Tesla has promised, people expected, and the time frames they expected/promised them in. A great deal of this variation (or misunderstanding depending on your position) has been driven not by the contracts or software itself, but by the public statements of Elon, something that may or may not be legally binding for the purposes of the contract, but certainly is an issue for public perception and also for entities such as the SEC who have demonstrated their concern about timing and content of those communications in the past."
mbetme,grz7htk,">They just have to get it to the point that it is safe enough to release to the masses.  It doesn‚Äôt need to be great or work everywhere.

I genuinely don't know what this means. When it comes to driving in the real world, I'm not sure ""safe enough to release to the masses"" can mean anything *but* ""great and works everywhere"".

Edit: To be fair, the ""everywhere"" part could refer to geofencing, which is a reasonable qualifier. But the ""great"" part is a lot trickier. Whether or not drivers are paying attention, there are simply too many ways this FSD beta can do harm as more and more people get it. Whether it's the system making an error on its own, or asking the driver to take over but the driver failing to do so, or whatever. We'll be rolling more and more dice more and more often, and that almost means by definition that serious accidents will therefore become more and more likely."
mbetme,gryndt9,"I think the relevant legal, marketing, and customer service issue here is not about the absolute time for delivery or delivery relative to the market, but rather delivery relative to the purchase date, life-cycle of the purchased vehicles, and assertations of Tesla and Elon specifically."
mbetme,gsv0v5d,"I've seen this argument floated a number of times. I guess I have two answers to it: 

The first is that the blanket argument seems wrong. Level 5 autonomy is possible with just cameras. The proof is in the fact that deaf humans can legally drive and they are statistically safer than fully-abled drivers. You CAN operate a vehicle safely with little or no sensory information outside of binary vision. 

However, that doesn't mean more specific arguments don't have merit. For example, it has been demonstrated that the quality and positioning of the cameras on Tesla vehicles render it having blindspots and issues with distance vision. There are also questions as to if the computational hardware available is sufficient to make the required decisions in real time if those earlier issues are overcome. Lastly, as you pointed out, just because it is possible, doesn't mean it is the best way to go about it. It stands to reason that additional information and additional computational power to work with it would result in better outcomes."
mbetme,gsasc23,"That is an interesting side discussion. My theory on that is that the Founders Edition Roadster was effectively a way for Tesla's more wealthy and supportive friends to loan them a quarter million dollars without showing it that way on the books. If you take a skeptical view of the other items, it isn't a big leap to see how it could always have been a vector of financial slight of hand."
mbetme,gsarwkk,"Most of the legal arguments here hinge on if Elon's public statements constitute official marketing for Tesla. If they are, Tesla potentially has major exposure already even if the product is delivered because of the delays.

Regarding the ""appreciating value"" statements specifically: Tesla's own trade-in value associated with FSD is $0.00. If you can't transfer the license and you can't sell it, it can't be an asset, much less an appreciating one. The validity of that part of the argument isn't really debatable."

Whether a court determines that Elon's statements rise to the level of false advertising would be a determination of fact and is anyone's guess. But, the fact that Elon uses his personal account to tweet doesn't make it okay to mislead consumers.

Going back to the original question, the remedy would almost certainly be money. No court could force a company to provide a service, product, or feature that doesn't exist, and I'm fairly certain that no court would force a company to provide a service, product, or feature that is unsafe or against the law or other regulations.

If it happens, it'd be a fascinating case study. The money from these purchases almost certainly kept the company afloat (I think Elon has mentioned several times that Tesla has been on bankruptcy's doorstep a few times), and now (thanks in part to the company's operations and in part to its investment in bitcoin) they have plenty of capital.

The fact that they are giving me nothing for the FSD in trade-in (they actually admitted on the phone to me that they will take my trade-in, REMOVE FSD, and then resell it), but are happy to charge me another $10,000 for FSD in my new car seems so over the top crazy to me.  Why would they do this?  It is like they are begging us to sue them!  Why not just let me keep my FSD and transfer it to my new $80,000 car??  I just really don't understand this strategy."
mbetme,h4xu6to,Probably not in any reasonable time frame
mbetme,gsicvq6,"Ok? I'm not saying I want to file anything, but I just assumed there's more litigious people out there than myself.

mbetme,gs9ngmp,"I love my Tesla and make no prediction about what will happen to the company in 3+ years (when I‚Äôll be looking to buy something new) but they‚Äôve skated by for *far* too long in some aspects (uneven at best/shitty at worst customer service, quality issues galore, the FSD lie, etc) due to being the only show in town: an EV company that made fast cars with good range.

But that time is quickly coming to an end. Can they survive and thrive? Sure they can. Will they? Who knows. But the gap between Tesla and the competition - especially VW Group‚Äôs offerings - is shrinking rapidly."
mbetme,gs9dok4,Same. I think I‚Äôm almost certain it won‚Äôt be.
mbetme,gsc166m,"I've preordered a (non-launch edition) Rivian already. I might still buy another Tesla before the Rivian actually gets delivered just because we need a larger car, but I'm honestly pretty pissed about the FSD nonsense especially since I preordered so long ago that we were supposed to be in the early access program so at the very least you'd think they'd have let us run the beta. But no, even that was nonsense.

It's also very clear that there's no way true FSD is coming anytime soon. My car decided yesterday that there was a stoplight in the middle of an expressway and started to slow down all of a sudden. Maybe the GPS signal was goofy or something, but that is absolutely not something that really inspires a lot of confidence about this car being a Robotaxi.

It does seem like maybe Tesla gives people who own FSD a higher trade in credit now? I'm not entirely sure, but the trade in offer they gave me was equivalent to the KBB private party sales price for my car which seems relatively aggressive."
mbetme,gsi2e99,"In the beginning I was hoping that autosteer worked well enough to make my commute easier.  It wasn't trustworthy then but the adaptive cruse worked very well.  Now autopilot with autosteer and auto lane change really helps.  I seldom have the need to use navigate on autopilot, but it seems OK when I have.  The speed limit detection also works well, but still misses a few spots.  I would like to see the bad weather performance improve and more complete point to point automatic navigation.  I would also like the green and yellow light detection to be fully functional."

Usually there is one or two moments the driver takes control, but even then it's not that they absolutely have to, they are just being cautious. So yeah it's not FSD yet, but it is damn close, and is safely Self Driving the vast majority of the time in the vast majority of circumstances."

mbetme,gryrlvf,"Revenue recognition rules are pretty straightforward and governed by various regulatory bodies. They haven't delivered FSD - by their own admission - so they cannot recognize money they have collected as revenue. They may be able to recognize some of it (for various features that it provides, I guess, like smart summon), but since they haven't completed the job they can't recognize all of it. Like your tax example, they may or may not have the cash on hand but that doesn't relieve them of the responsibility of delivering on the promise before recognizing revenue."
mbetme,gs4wv6x,It‚Äôs under deferred revenue. Same as deposits.
mbetme,gsbi79k,"its classified as deferred revenue and is listed as a liability, on the asset side this is balanced by the increase in cash balance. So these funds would be listed under assets under Cash or restricted cash and would be balanced by a similar liability entry of deferred revenue.

Deferred revenue would not show up on the income statement, so any profits and revenues you see DO NOT include sales of FSD. Although when you look at the balance sheet these revenues will be reflected under deferred revenue so you could use that as a proxy to evaluate the financial liability they would have. To see the impact on the balance sheet just deduct that figure from the cash balance or current assets and see how debt/equity levels look. Given its market cap TSLA could provide these funds through a share offering but as an investor that would mean fewer assets for you and more dilution."

mbetme,gs669wp,"I‚Äôm not privy to those details either..  Although I have been following every quarterly report for the last several years.  They release a portion of the FSD deferred revenue with each new feature.  For example the released a bit with NavOnAutopilot and a bit more with Smart Summon.  Not sure exactly what percentages or amounts those were, since there are other sources of deferred revenue and they all get clumped together on the balance sheet.."
mbetme,grz71dk,"It does have a bearing.  ""The percentage of value actually provided would become a matter of the court"" as debated/presented by expert accounting witnesses and company financial executives.  As long as the math is defensible in court or could reasonably be explained under generally accepted accounting practices, Tesla's estimate of costs/revenue recognition is likely to prevail.

Don't forget you also have auditors looking at the claims, and you better believe that early revenue recognition and liability understatements are closely looked at.  It takes more than handwaving and a simple spreadsheet to persuade professional skepticism of the Big 4 accounting firms."
mbetme,grzzdly,"Check the line which says ""deferred revenue"" on the balance sheet. Under accounting, unearned revenue is a liability. Tesla sets those cash aside each quarter, and it will start recognize these partial revenues as more features come out delivering to the customer.

Tesla has actually done this with the safest way possible even if FSD fails to deliver its features so it has to give out refunds."
mbetme,gs3bpyg,"With no timeline. They will deliver the features, label that feature complete FSD, recognize above 90% of FSD revenues, then keep improving until they are able to accomplish their goal."

I hope Tesla is the one to crack it. I have 2 model 3 eagerly waiting on them to crack it.  That does not mean I am blinded by the total and utter failure on the state time line, nor do I think they are the only ones who will get this job done.

I think it is easy to hover in the doubting camp but not lets get the pitch forks and torches, when Tesla is not running a giant gorilla marketing machine of showing you what you cant have, then having elon tease releases just to once again blow them badly.  That does not bolster my confidence nor does it infuse me with more of that keep the faith attitude.  


The worst part is people will go oh your a FUD person you short these people. No, I own 2 of these products and have been strung along like the rest of you. I am just a bit annoyed at being strung along over and over.  The marketing of the FSD to twitter people was a great way to justify the 2k price hike. That did not follow with a single release of a single thing to a single paying customer in the general population.  They did not even provide us the Tidal music they teased at battery day.  So yeah bitterness is developed, as you see software you paid for dangled over your head, and elon sayin you too soon..... then blows it.   So yeah I am leaning out of the faithful camp, mostly due to being burned by this time he has his crap together and is telling us straight just to be met with nope....


There is not much else he tweets about with his companies that is so far off the mark that it starts to feel a bit fake.  Even battery day and his tweets are backed up with leaks of Pano buying in.

No. Tesla got that capital with recent capital raises. Capital raises that were made with promises of ""robotaxis"" and such. Losing a FSD lawsuit would also make Tesla instantly liable for that ""robotaxis at the end of 2021"" claim that was used to raise billions of $$$."

mbetme,gsicexf,"It is interesting that you defined your expectations that way. One of the discussions I've been having with people is about how AP and FSD are often confused. I've found that most of the people who defend FSD's progress highlight features that are technically AP features.

It's a reality that the two things are the same software, but I would argue that improvements delivered in the software over the last few years fall into two categories: First, incremental improvements to the AP features (autosteer and cruise). Second, FSD functionality improvements that have largely been foundational but not independently useful. Features such as the traffic visualizations demonstrate object labeling. The ability to stop and even chime at traffic controls shows progress but does not actually implement it a way that is materially functional to reduce driver's manual input (arguably, this actually increases the amount of operator effort when it is turned on).

Navigate on AP is a particularly interesting case study for this bit of hair-splitting because it is part of the ""FSD"" feature set, but is named ""Navigate on -A-P-"" and in function is little more than letting GPS automatically execute the functionality that AP could already do by pressing the turn signal if it was initiated by a human. This means that someone could hack that functionality by literally just connecting a Garmin to the turn signal stalk of an existing AP-only car.

This sounds like nit-picky stuff, but I think what I'm trying to argue (or at least clarify in my own head) is that the development progress that has made it into the production fleet software (not Beta) has been focused on the included AP functionality, not on the functionality that FSD buyers actually paid for. Or to say it another way, these are things Tesla would/should have been doing as part of the normal progression of the free/included portion of the car's software anyhow.

What I have started to believe (and many have actually said directly as a defense) is that Tesla is effectively running a Kickstarter project here with FSD but not really being honest about presenting it as such to either customers or investors. The key principals that make Kickstarter a successful and ethical mechanism is that buyers very clearly understand the risks they are taking by backing, the delivery criteria in both functions and time are clear, and that the development and marketing of the project has to be honest and transparent. Tesla runs afoul of most of these principals."
mbetme,gsri4j6,"My expectations when I got my 2018 P3D+ with PUP for $80k was that my car could do 310 miles and about 80% of that if I charge between 10%-90%. I was soooo very wrong. Real world distance is about 200 miles at best with hypermile and no HVAC (Tesla service can't find any fault in my drive style too). The car in 2019 was downrated in its EPA range to 299 as the max ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

I still have the HW 2.5 computer and I am holding out in getting HW 3 until they actually do release FSD (not FSD lite).

It really is a waste of money. I suspect that buy month 36, my car will be worth 50% of what I paid for it. I don't know about you, but that is horrible depreciation. Do you have any idea on how many oil changes and gasoline $40k can buy?"

It‚Äôs very close to feature complete, not foolproof, but let‚Äôs look at driving from point A to B.

It‚Äôs series of rather disjoint and imperfect features, but it can pull out of a driveway, drive city streets, drive highway, and pull into a driveway, and also self park (to a degree). User interaction required

All of those are far from perfect, but, it makes an attempt to do nearly the full trip. It‚Äôs literally self driving (controlling acceleration, steering angle, and navigation).

mbetme,grzhnfq,There's a very fair argument that current iterations of summon do not deliver what was promised.   And it certainly does not allow you to get out of the car at your destination and then allow the car to go park itself (as was written in the original fsd product bullet points).
mbetme,gs7edca,"I think where your argument doesn't resonate with me is that the product's name is literally ""Full Self Driving"" and every ten seconds for the last four years Elon has been out there saying ""just a few more months"". In some cases he literally used the words ""level 5"" and the robotaxi and appreciating asset comments don't leave a lot of wiggle room for the defense you (and in fairness, a lot of people) have made. 

My understanding of the law (I am NOT a lawyer or have a legal degree) based on the research I've done is that Tesla's legal team will certainly go in and state everything you've said and absent a counter argument, it would be very effective. However, the petitioner's team will spend weeks presenting every tweet, YouTube video, sales training document, and sales advisor to customer e-mail that stands in stark contrast to the wording of the contract. At which time they will lose. 

All that being said, I've made the point over and over again that this doesn't have to go to court for this to get really ugly for Tesla. All that has to happen is for the FSD release to drag on or for it to not live up to hype and the disappointed customers and competitor's marketing teams are going to paint the company and Elon as snake oil salesmen. 

I've been sounding the alarm for quite some time that the build quality and service organization needs substantial improvement as well. When Tesla was the only game in town, it could afford to make mistakes and recover. That flexibility is rapidly fading and if the company doesn't get on top of this stuff, it will bite them hard and soon.

My 2 cents anyhow."
mbetme,gs8qb2o,"This is true. However, if you think about it, AP can change lanes, it just needs user input to prompt it. Most ""nav on autopilot"" is just a lane change and then following the lane. The the FSD functionality is just applying the existing AP functionality automatically. The FSD upgrade is no more complicated than traditional GPS in this case with the possible exception of the logic for moving lanes to avoid slow traffic."

But: Tesla should also put in a policy that anyone who got a refund is not eligible for future discounts/sales, so they would have to pay full inflated price if they want to buy back in when it is ready.

mbetme,gryj175,"The only way to not make mis-statements on something that's not done is to not talk about it.

I'd rather Tesla talked than didn't."
mbetme,grxk2q1,"That‚Äôs not what it has always said, though. Back when Enhanced AP existed, FSD was purely a preorder for functionality that it is unlikely they will ever be able to deliver on current hardware (whether they offer future retrofits remains to be seen).

They retconned what ‚ÄúFSD‚Äù means at some point, so they could redefine it to include things they‚Äôd already delivered and at L2/ADAS level functionality.

Are they trying or ‚Äúhoping‚Äù to go beyond L2 on current cars? Perhaps. Elon often talks (including at official events) like it‚Äôs a certainty. But I‚Äôm skeptical.

I think they‚Äôll add an L3 and eventually L4 mode down the road, but only with newer hardware (at least an updated radar, but probably other changes too). However I don‚Äôt know what that will mean for current owners.

I think they will get in trouble for the name, as it clearly conveys that it is ‚Äúfull‚Äù and ‚Äúself-driving‚Äù, which is definitely not something any reasonable person would interpret as an ADAS. That would be like advertising options of ‚Äú720p‚Äù and ‚ÄúFull HD‚Äù where the latter is advertised as ‚Äúit will display every pixel of your 1080p content in its full glory, yes really!‚Äù and then later saying that ‚ÄúFull HD‚Äù actually just meant 720p but with HDMI input or something. It‚Äôs a bait-and-switch, and the name itself make it very hard for them to get out of it without giving people refunds, I think.

I bet we see regulators force them to change the name, and they‚Äôll try to use this as a way to complete the retcon of what it is with a new name that better describes what it is - e.g. ‚ÄúFull Driving Assistance‚Äù, and at that point they‚Äôll either have to give people at least partial refunds or be forced to pay back buyers some other way (e.g. lawsuit)."
mbetme,grxup9l,"If a reasonable person thinks that he or she bought the promise, then he or she has a case. Just because you don't think an FSD purchase included future features or improvements doesn't mean that's what everyone thinks. I'm not a litigator, but I wouldn't want to defend a company from a false advertising claim or class action with Elon's tweets as evidence."
mbetme,gryez67,If he makes untrue statements about FSD on twitter (which is treated like a press release) then sure it can.

mbetme,h3gdozf,"Of course it says that these features will evolve.  ""As these self-driving features evolve, your car will be continuously upgraded through over-the-air software updates"".  It does not say IF these self-driving features evolve"".  It says AS these features evolve.  I have been speaking English for 57 years now.  That statement implies that these features will evolve and my car will get them.  Any other interpretation requires some very difficult mental gymnastics."
mbetme,gryfe0e,"That doesn‚Äôt make them immune from customers getting pissed and suing before those 100 years are up.. At some point, customers will not accept ‚Äúlater this year or next year‚Äù especially when they‚Äôre ready for a new vehicle.

mbetme,gry9tz9,Do you have proof of this? FSD was < 4k in 2018 AFAIK.
mbetme,grydp81,"No, maybe you are thinking of the price of AP/EAP + FSD (before they made AP standard and just raised the prices of the vehicles a bit). Otherwise the price of FSD never was $10K by itself in 2018."

mbetme,gsl74xu,"I basically agree.  However, Elon has always been known for setting ambitious targets.  The fact that Tesla didn't go bankrupt and now dominates electric cars, and that Space X dominates the launch business shows what this can accomplish.  Also Elon attracts the very best young engineers.  I think true level 5 self driving is really hard.  However, humans have been driving with only visual clues for a long time.  The AI behind this is what's hard to match.  Would I pay $10,000 for this vision?  No."
mbetme,gsrifee,Elon said that all people who lease their cars will not be able to buy it at the end of the lease because they intend to have it be part of the robotaxi fleet. It is now 2021 and no where near a robotaxi service because FSD is just on youtube videos and nothing real owners can use
mbetme,gsrodx2,"I paid around $75,000 for my Model 3 performance.  Kelly Blue book says it's worth between $47,000 and $41,000.  I have over 40,000 miles on it.  I save around $100/month over the cost of operating my Subaru BRZ.  I paid around $30,000 in the BRZ's first year of availability  and sold it for $13,000 in 2018 after 100,000 miles.  

So in depreciation the BRZ cost was $.17 per mile.  The Tesla's depreciation is around $.85 per mile so far.  The savings are around $.10 per mile.  However, well see how much the cost changes when the Tesla has 100,000 miles on it in a few years.  I bet it will be around the same barring the serious price cuts from 2018 until now.  The used price is still very close to the current new price.  That would bring the depreciation down to $.34 per mile and the savings to around $.06 per mile.  

If you didn't want to spend that kind of money on one of the highest performance production sedans available, you should by a real sports car like the BRZ.  It costs a lot less than I paid for it these days.  You get a great 6 speed manual transmission in a rear wheel drive vehicle with superior handling due to its good weight distribution and a low CG.  

All the other Tesla features like Autopilot are frosting on the cake.  You are right about the 200 mile range, but did you ever believe the EPA gas mileage ratings?  For nearly all my trips, 200 miles is enough.  Again the above is the cost of being an early adapter.  There are less expensive electric cars out there and lots less expensive IC engine cars. Of course if I put the same money into Tesla stock when I bought my car, I could afford something really special today.  But would it have Tesla acceleration?"
mbetme,gs5bgdg,"> 98% of the time is not ‚Äúdamn close‚Äù wrt an actual full-autonomous system

mbetme,grzufup,"Full self driving seems to be describing the capabilities, ie. getting a person from point A to B with the ability to make turns/stop at stop signs. It in no way describes 100% autonomous without interventions ever. I'm pretty sure the lawyer will define it was fully capable of self driving as it has done it from these videos on youtube.  

Even things that are advertised as fully autonomous like a roomba still requires lot of interventions."
mbetme,grzhrxv,"On Autonomy Day, Elon specifically said that you would be able to sleep.  Having to constantly pay attention and take over when necessary does not fulfill that at all."
mbetme,gs39w7h,"Tesla's own page still says ""no action required by the person in the driver‚Äôs seat.""

Paying attention and having to keep your hand on the wheel are actions."
mbetme,grzf3wu,‚ÄúFull self driving in some anecdotal circumstances‚Äù is not the same as ‚Äúfull self driving‚Äù
mbetme,gs1ddf5,"Today, FSD beta is more of a killing machine than it is anything else. Remember, we're talking about DRIVING here - that means no dead pedestrians, no going the wrong way down a one way street, no T-boning another vehicle - think about the real implications of the word DRIVING. It seems that by any meaningful definition that driving would have some respect for traffic laws and, well, you know..... not killing people."
mbetme,gsa9a1s,"I don't disagree with you. This thread, though, deals with Tesla's exposure and I don't think there is much. They have delivered, or are close to delivering (based on the videos on youtube) something that will indeed get you to a self-driving car. Some can argue that if you touch anything at all, it's not FSD (because it isn't ""full"") but most people - I believe - would feel that entering an address when the car has left your driveway, and having the car get you to the parking lot of the destination without intervention, would meet the requirement."
mbetme,gry12r6,I agree that this will not be clear until (and if) it is tested in court.
mbetme,gs51mo6,"I‚Äôll never buy a Detroit car as long as they cling to the dealership model. Most of the foreign automakers at least keep a tight reign on their dealerships.

mbetme,gsdqwsb,"And all those people that actually have functioning babysit-FAD beta. Is it perfect? No, but no one else is anywhere close.

Tesla will be able to continually improve other products are essentially fixed."
mbetme,gs0pffe,"Well may not realistically see the FULL value they paid or expected maybe. But they have already received a certain % of the value they paid for with FSD exclusive features. And I'd say by the end of this year Tesla will have delivered a better iteration of their current Beta to the rest of the customers who have purchased FSD - which they will say is Feature complete FSD (and recognize basically all FSD revenue). They'll keep working from there to reach L5 maybe a few years from now... Anyways if they do that by the end of the year, thats only 4.5 years from when the Model 3 came out. Thats important because something like 2/3rds of all Teslas sold to date have happened between Q1 2019-Now, so from like July 2017 when Model 3 deliveries started, that's probably like 80% of all Teslas are under 4 years old... and that's only increasing massively over time. So I don't think we are there yet since the avg new car is owned 6 years.."
mbetme,grztu0o,"Again Tesla sold FSD as a group of features. Once they deliver those features that would make it feature complete and they'll recognize probably 95-100% of FSD revenues. They also promised that you would continue to get the software updates to those features that eventually improve it to an autonomous vehicle with no timeline on that and dependent upon regulations. But once they deliver Feature Complete FSD they will basically have 0% risk to a lawsuit.

There is only 1 logical explanation for why they keep all FSD revenue in a separate account that they don't allow themselves to use/recognize. Its because they understand that they would be at risk to refund it (possibly plus interest) in the case of a lost lawsuit. That also means the that they believe strongly they are lowering their risk significantly with every feature release exclusive to FSD. The only explanation is because clearly they are assigning a value to each feature which adds up to feature complete FSD. You just don't do that unless you are really confident you'd win in court.

Legit IF (just a scenario not a prediction) they deliver Feature Complete FSD and announced they gave up on achieving L5 Self Driving, I doubt they'd lose in court."

I doubt it.   I don't think Elon works like that.   I think he believes what he says, but it's more that it's really hard."
mbetme,gs58kr3,"Courts are **very** favorable to idiot consumers vs mega corporation lawyers.   Hiding shit in fine print only gives you 5 seconds of cover before ""reasonable persons"" start getting bantered back and forth. 

Would a reasonable person have read and understood the contract?  Could a reasonable person be expected to be aware that they had agreed to something? 

A contract must at its heart be an exchange.   When the balance of power is extremely skewed as it is between Tesla and its consumers and when that party agrees to terms without any benefit to the consumer e.g. forced arbitration then that's a vulnerable part of the contract.  

If I have a contract that says ""You will give me $100."" it won't stand up in court unless I give you something reasonably $100 in value in return.  Tesla can't waive the ability to participate in a class action without giving me something equally valuable to me in return."
mbetme,gs5p972,"Fine print gets overruled by other facts & circumstances. 

When people paid up for FSD, leased a car for 3 years and turned it in and got nothing for it, a civil case will absolutely gain standing and be brought to a civil trial. 

Having the CEO constantly promising & pumping the ‚Äúnon existent product‚Äù will absolutely impact the results 

I had GCs reporting to me in a number of very litigious industries when I ran companies for PE, I‚Äôve been deposed dozens of times, handled arbitration‚Äôs and taken a few cases to trial.  

Tesla does not want this going to trial."
mbetme,grz51c5,"I actually dont think the first part of this would be a bad marketing move.

mbetme,gryd58q,"He's either lying or misremembering. FSD was $3k when you bought it with your car in 2018. Maybe he's including enhanced autopilot in his ""$10k"" number (which still wouldn't be accurate but would be closer). Still, that's pretty disingenuous. He paid a lot for EAP, which was delivered to him as promised. He did not pay nearly that much for FSD, which is where there's the issue of the features not being delivered in a timely manner. So it's *potentially* a $3k issue, certainly not a $10k one."
mbetme,gryfk5o,[deleted]
mbetme,gsssi4y,"That is also an interesting side discussion. Without internal documents it is impossible to know, but I'm wondering what their internal projections where for that. You can't take thousands of vehicles off of lease and put them into service in that capacity without a lot of time going into preparing the robotaxi business, funding, regulatory approvals, etc. Either there is a bunch of documentation out there somewhere showing when and how they planned to execute on that OR there is none, which indirectly is evidence that they didn't really expect it to be ready any time soon."
mbetme,gsrozii,"I have a 2008 e90 335xi FBO as well. Had it since 2011 as a cpo car with 17k miles on it. It now has 195k miles and is still boosting like it was when I first got it.

Ownership costs are next to nothing because all the parts I get are from FCPEuro, so it's basically free parts and I DIY on labor for anything that doesn't need to lift the car off the ground.

I also have a 2015 sienna limited premium awd was $44k for a $48k msrp. I have 85k miles on it and its still worth at least $25k because of condition and full tint on all glass. I also have the toyota 10yr / 125k mile platinum extended warranty with zero deductible. I do oil changes early on both the sienna and the BMW at about 7500 miles.

What I would have got instead, I would have got a 2015 cpo bmw M3 instead of the tesla. It really is a much better ride."
mbetme,gs6w6uc,"Eh, I‚Äôm willing to give Tesla their share of credit. My Kona EV has LKA and adaptive cruise...I‚Äôd say 98% of the time is a good estimate *if* the road is nicely paved / doesn‚Äôt have strange patchwork which obscures lane markers, and *if* you‚Äôre traveling over 40 mph (required for LKA to take the wheel).

I‚Äôm sure (positive, in fact) that Tesla‚Äôs system is more capable and robust than that. But to your point, I‚Äôm not sure that it matters in the grand scheme of things since LKA + adaptive cruise takes >80% of the work out of commutes as-is compared to more basic systems."
mbetme,gs0ebam,"Idk. My CTS is ‚Äúfully capable‚Äù of 50 mpg under the right circumstances, but no way in hell would Cadillac ever attempt to rate or advertise it as such. Hyundai tried that a few years ago and got slapped with a pretty big fine.

But I get your point. Tesla would probably worm their way out of it by trying to define ‚Äòis‚Äô..."
mbetme,grzrvgh,"I agree, it does not fulfill that statement.

I agree that until it does you aren't getting what Elon promised you.

I do not agree however that a reasonable interpretation of the description ""full self driving"" necessarily requires level 5 or even 4 autonomy. Level 3, driver available, but the car 100% drives itself and only needs a driver in case of extreme emergency, like computer failure, is full self driving by a reasonable interpretation of that title.

You should be pissed at Elon of he lied it overstated, but if you discount his statements, then the beta is very close to level 3 and therefore to FSD."
mbetme,gs3btze,"The argument is whether it is close to FSD, and people are saying it isn't even close. My point is that it is in fact close.

Currently you can get in a beta tesla and have it drive you on a bunch of trips and it will get you there without the driver taking control 95% of the time, and 95% of the time the driver does take control it still would have completed the trip safely, but the driver got nervous or saw a minor issue and took control.

Once those gaps are closed, and regulatory requirements meet out will be level 3 and no action will be required except in emergency and unusual driving conditions. 4 will likely not be far behind. 5 is thousands of times harder than 4 though, so not betting on that soon.

So point is, or is on fact close to a reasonable definition of full self driving."
mbetme,gs1ed0i,"Same can be said with humans.

Not only are you confusing FSD with lvl 5, but you‚Äôre giving unattainable goals to lvl 5 which are not required."

mbetme,gs7wciq,"I am in alignment with most of your latest response. I dont feel that there is benefit in demanding everything instantly. There is an argument that Elon and company messaging needs to change. At some point being ambitious or optimistic no longer buys you flexibility. It just becomes lies. I am not there yet myself, but if things dont change, I probably will be. 

What I want from Tesla is more transparency and more frequent updates. For example, I feel like there hasnt been much released in the last 18 months that added value other than reading limit signs. The stop light/sign thing is almost useless without auto go. So much so that I turned it off. Summon is a nice trick when it works, but the situations it does are too limited to make consistent use of. Navigate usually works pretty well, but when it misses, it misses hard and repeatably. 

I have a particular angle on this. Part of my job is software development. If ran my client‚Äôs projects the way Tesla treats us FSD early adopters, I‚Äôd get fired."
mbetme,grzcnpx,"That isnt a legal defense. Certainly not a defense in the court of public opinion. I hear what you are arguing often, but ‚ÄúI was too stupid to know people were going to buy because I claimed this‚Äù is about the last thing he will or would want to say."

mbetme,grxl7m0,"If they‚Äôre able to release any L3 mode anywhere it would probably help them limit their problems here... maybe. Or at least buy more time for people to forget.

I think one way out is if they do come up with a hardware retrofit program and give it to everyone who‚Äôs paid for ‚ÄúFSD‚Äù for free. But I think that‚Äôs unlikely to happen, and a lot of people will have paid and gotten nothing for it because they no longer have those cars.

mbetme,gs9c062,"I don't see how you're missing this. It says ""as they evolve"" not ""if they evolve"". They call out the risk that regulatory approval ""may take longer in some jurisdictions,"" but there is no mention that that may not happen in the first place."

I'm kinda disappointed Elon hasn't replied to this accusation with one of his signature condescending/Iamverysmart ""I never specified which planet's year"" tweets yet. Guess he'd rather everyone forget just about how long this promise has been an empty one."
mbetme,grzubiv,"No you didn't though lol. If you were to sue in court today, you would have literally 0 shot of getting even a dime back for the amount you paid for AP/EAP. AP is separate from FSD. You got what you paid for with AP/EAP. 

Secondly you wouldn't even get all the amount you paid for FSD either because you do have features that are exclusive to FSD (that neither AP/EAP receive) that you are able to use, meaning you are receiving at least some of the features you paid for. So let's say you paid $3k for AP, and $7K for FSD... If a court ruled in your favor you'd get max like $3-4K back."
mbetme,gsw2siq,"I believe the answer is, Elon is an awesome PR/Marketing team of 1. I am confident he will say he had all the intentions to get it done but had it ""delayed"" because of <insert excuse>, just like the time lines from pretty much everything since the original roadster ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I'm not saying anyone should bring up legal action, I think Elon is awesome for basically making EVs a reality AND for building out a supercharging network. He built a new car company from scratch and it is a viable company.

I do believe ""eventually"" he will get there (where ever ""there"" is). But it will be such a long road to that destination. Maybe like 10 years realistically. The FSD we are sold an image of and what Elon will actually deliver to cash the check are going to be VASTLY different with a gap that will be bigger than the Grand Canyon. I'm sure as long as Elon can keep milking money from buyers to fund the FSD project he will keep saying the product is ""complete"" for that round. Just like HW 1.0, HW 2.0, HW 2.5, and now HW 3.0... you can't blame the hardware chips for the lack of performance either... it was the code being run on an emulator for backward compatibility which was the deficit. Had they actually wrote native code for the HW version, I'm sure each Nvidia chip could have been up to the task that we are doing today with HW 3.0.

Upgrading the chip was just a side effect reason to ask for more money. I suspect once 5G wireless is more established in infrastructure... we will have an even more awesome HW 3.5/4.0 available which can do ""FSD"" or maybe call it ""FSD+"" or some other nomenclature as such.

Kudos to Elon for driving the industry to change, but I have no illusions that I am funding it today with my dollars today and no product in the foreseeable near future that will drive on its own correctly without user intervention.

In my mind, a real FSD feature as normal everyday people understand it can only exist once every road feature has its own IP. Each cat eye on the road will have its own IP and communicate to near by cars important details as they get within range. Each car on the road will communicate with surrounding cars about what is going on and what it intends to do (almost like how planes have collusion avoidance systems and communicate with each other). The the last feature we need is in road wireless charging and wireless charging at parking lots (This would help reduce the need for BIG heavy batteries). If we can get simple slow charging while driving... it can make 40kwh batteries good enough to do 300+ miles coupled with superchargers in case you need something faster. Thats how I see it becoming a reality."

As far as autonomous driving goes -  I never mentioned it, nor do I think Tesla will achieve it first. Nor am I all that interested in it.

To be very clear - I'm saying that FSD is bad. It's dangerous. And Tesla is in a very, very wobbly place right now having written a number of checks it doesn't appear able to cash.

Lastly, Ford is going to wipe the floor with Tesla if Elon doesn't wise up.

That said, I love my Tesla and am happy I purchased it. I feel genuinely sorry for the people who paid more than $2-4k for FSD based on empty promises."
mbetme,gry4sug,"I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre referring to, I have not made any statements regarding the viability of a potential legal challenge against Tesla. I did point out the language in their agreements that addresses current and future features, as I believe it is relevant to the discussion and is often missed in favor of some louder sources such as Elon‚Äôs Twitter and various events and shareholder calls. Whether this language is sufficient to successfully shield them from all possible litigation is not something that I would date to try to determine or speculate on."
mbetme,gs8waxi,Polestar‚Äôs future looks promising too imo
mbetme,gsgj33l,Except none of that will be available on previous model years. It will always always always something you need to upgrade the entire vehicle for.
mbetme,gs4a6nd,"I think after Tesla releases Feature Complete FSD, whether or not they achieve L4/L5, any lawsuit will pose low risk for Tesla in the larger picture. Sure they could lose max of like $500 per customer who owns FSD. But they now charge $10k for it.... So who cares? Even the customers that paid $3K for FSD AND received the free FSD CPU upgrade they still made a profit off of.

They could also probably further substantially lower this risk by switching from torque on wheel driver monitoring to face/eye position driver monitoring, which we Know they are training. This is because they do still have a lot of material on the website (past and current) referring to hands off the wheel. So a good L3 system that is hands off really is all they need to provide to essentially cut their risk to zero imo.

However do I think they will achieve this L3, then not improve that to a L4 safety factor in 4 years? No. I think L4 with just vision will definitely happen by 2025 - and others may have it done by then as well, not just Tesla."
mbetme,gs3szk3,"The vast majority of people that own FSD have bought it in the last 3 years. Certainly nobody bought it for more than $3k before 2019. Seems like people want to act like they paid so much money and have been waiting a decade for this, when in reality that is not true. By the end of this year - most likely sooner - they will have Feature Complete FSD released to those who have purchased FSD. At that point they will have delivered on every feature they sold you. From there it is about constantly improving it to the point where you can safely take your hands off the wheel possibly switching to a different driver monitoring method using the interior camera they've already been testing (which btw would meet your initial comments point without even neccessitating L4/L5). Then it'll be about not having to pay attention at all in certain conditions...."
mbetme,grzjapk,"Interesting so I guess that future feature has a tentative name.

But I would point out that's on their tech hype page not the actual purchase screen in the configurator. Might be usable still but definitely not as much weight as the bullet points on the purchase page."

mbetme,gs5rsej,"Very informative, really adds to the debate üôÑ"
mbetme,grxlrb9,"I expect them to automatically flag roads with repeated no intervention drives on the L2 beta as ready for L3 then whole cities for L4 once enough is.

Part of why I think this will work is that the public AP already does quite literally all of my driving save turns (and the 2 short unmarked roads in my neighborhood) every day, and has done for the last year. (Those truns all have good visibility, and no 5+ way intersections so the beta should have no issues with them)"
mbetme,gsb5xtw,"I‚Äôm not at all surprised you don‚Äôt see how I‚Äôm missing it, that‚Äôs generally what it feels like when you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. As it evolves is not a statement regarding how far it will evolve, it‚Äôs a statement regarding the timing of updates relative to any future evolution of the tech."
mbetme,grzzjp9,I‚Äôd be cool with that.
mbetme,gs0rtda,"When FSD was 3k it was literally only FSD.  It excluded everything else including NoAP and summon.  So for some people the whole 3k might be up for grabs since city streets that isn't level 4 isn't FSD. 

They started changing the meaning of it later on and stuff got murky. Post FSD being only FSD, if you had level 2 city streets I can see that counting as partially delivered"
mbetme,gsxqz90,"First, I see validity in the general premise of your response. However, good intentions or not, eventual success or not, very clear promises and timelines were made and I'm concerned that the eventual delivery of it could be sabotaged by the legal/financial exposure. By most accounts, Tesla is on the hook for $1.5B-2.0B in refunds for just the FSD if they fail to deliver. That assumes that their liability is limited to FSD line item cost and not the whole or portion of the value of the underlaying vehicle. This is highly speculative, but my concern is this is the Achilles heel of the company. Just the PR nightmare it would bring on would kill Tesla if widespread litigation is started.

Regarding the technical assumptions you are making, I can see what you are saying. However, I've had the same discussions with people who insist that lidar is a prerequisite. I think it is fundamentally possible to do everything with just optical vision. The proof of this is in the fact that deaf people can drive and are statistically safer drivers than the general public with no sensory input outside of binary vision. 

That being said, doing it exclusively with cameras doesn't make it the best way to go about it. There is a lot of discussion as to if the existing Tesla cameras have sufficient resolution and field of vision. As you touched on, the onboard compute resources may or may not be sufficient. it stands to reason that more CPU and more sensory inputs would result in better outcomes."
mbetme,gs28hpr,"Yeah, they are working on that, but it requires the reliability to get a bit further along, and regulatory approval. FSD will get there, but it will take a while.

Elon needs to quit spouting off, that is by far their biggest problem and is losing them a lot of good will."
mbetme,gs1i6ya,">	Funny, I've driven well over a million miles in my lifetime - and I've never had an accident (knock on wood) or killed anyone. I'm a full self driver.

So is a 16 year old and a 107 year old. Yet not every human drives like every other human.

Let me know how many accidents and deaths have resulted from the FSD beta."
mbetme,gs4ak6f,But what if it simply doesn't happen by 2025? Would you personally join the lawsuit?
mbetme,gs3u36o,"You're still believing Elon's claims. I'm not.

>	. By the end of this year - most likely sooner - they will have Feature Complete FSD released to those who have purchased FSD. At that point they will have delivered on every feature they sold you. 

Until I am able to be driven without paying attention and without my hand on the wheel, they haven't delivered."
mbetme,grzjodq,"Purchase page details have changed too since 2017, but I haven't been able to track down the originals yet."
mbetme,gs8piwj,"Most of this is fair if not exactly my experience. I'd say my MX did a better job of ""just driving"" on the highway a year ago than it does now. 

I think what I meant primarily by incremental updates and transparency is that I wanted to see the rewrite applied to existing functionality before city streets functionality. There is a lot of improvement available yet on highway AP/FSD and that is where it is most useful for me. That portion of it (in my opinion) has been largely stagnant of late.   


I'd also like to see something that will probably never happen. I'd like Elon to acknowledge the delays and put forth some sort of plan, even if a token one, to address it. Things like hiring a dozen additional engineers or building a better bug reporting and tracking system so we know if they are even aware and working on stuff. This portion of things is being done in relative secrecy. I am used to having access to bug tracking and feature requests for any other major piece of software I work on. I don't see how my car should be any different, especially if the argument is that a Tesla is a computer on wheels, not a car with a computer."
mbetme,grxmd6h,"That isn‚Äôt how any of this works.

There are a ton of things they haven‚Äôt even attempted to cover yet, which are crucial for going from ADAS to ADS (L3+). And they‚Äôre going to need sensor redundancy, and to fix obvious hardware problems today like the pillar cameras being blinded by condensation. At minimum they‚Äôll also need a better front radar, and possibly rear and cross-traffic ones. I‚Äôm still curious if we will discover any AP hardware changes in the new S/X models.

The biggest problem for them might occur whenever they do release something better on newer cars. That‚Äôs when ‚ÄúFSD‚Äù owners will say ‚Äúhey, why aren‚Äôt I getting that? I paid for it!‚Äù"
mbetme,gs0070b,"...well note I said IF a court ruled in your favor. Not that they would. 

Literally once Tesla roles out their current Beta to the entire fleet of owners who purchased FSD (almost certainly by the end of this year imo) they will be feature complete and recognize basically 100% of revenues. That doesn't mean it will be L5 obviously, just that the features will be released which is all they really sold people."
mbetme,gs33g8h,"EAP never included Smart Summon or Nav on City Streets. Nav on City Streets is what the beta testers are testing right now. Smart summon obviously is kinda garbage but they've already recognized some revenue due to its release. So even for those that bought EAP, and thus FSD when it was only $3K, they also would not be able to get their full money back - especially if/when Tesla released the Beta to all FSD owners.

Imagine it like this: Tesla sold a set of features along with the promise that they'd continue delivering software updates with the goal of reaching full Autonomy (Elon has only like once saidL5 was the goal btw). They never gave an official timeline on reaching that when you bought the product, and have repeatedly said its dependent upon regulations, which aren't in their control. 
Each feature they release they recognize a larger portion of the revenue until they have fully delivered all the features (aka feature complete FSD) at which point they will have recognized at least 90% (probably more like 95%+) of FSD revenues. So at this point if you were to sue, you'd be arguing in court that you've received all the promised features, they just aren't as good as promised - you can see how that will be a tough argument. Secondly even if you do win, youre only getting that % they haven't recognized ~5%-10% refund (plus maybe interest)...
I agree that they have been promising more capability than what these features are delivering though, which is what the last like 5%-10% is for. Basically after they fully release the current Beta version of FSD, the max anyone would win in court is like <$500."
mbetme,gsxt1dm,"Great points, but if deaf people make great drivers... why don't we all put ear plugs in our ears to drive ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (yes I know a silly answer to you).

Because the added sensory feature is generally accepted as an advantage rather than a disadvantage. Just like Lidar and any other feature you can toss into the mix will add another layer of assistance. I get the argument of cost. When optical computer mice first came out they were super expensive. Today, you can get optical computer mice for next to nothing. Scale always brings down costs.

I would argue heat sensors and night vision could also help computers be better drivers than humans.

You still have the Predator movie issue where the human actor fell into mud and the alien couldn't sense the human because he was cold (the Alien was using the wrong sensor for the job). Where as the heat sensor was the perfect tool up to that point to hunt the humans in the first movie (Yes this is an 80's movie reference).

I do fault Elon for being too ""Engineer-y"" by saying Lidar is dumb. When you are developing something new and revolutionary like Self Driving (Autonomous driving)... you want every advantage you can have. Then you refine/distill it to remove the redundancies after a good PoC exists. Thats the normal engineering process. Elon's approach is ass backwards, but hey... he is a somebody and I am a nobody ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
mbetme,gs51kcn,"I won't need to tell you how many.... the news that FSD is shelved to be ""replatformed with new hardware and advanced neural network"" will be right around the corner. Some of ya'll are in pretty serious denial about market delivery vs. market promise. It's not even cute anymore."
mbetme,gs4ddvd,"Don't own one atm. But It probably depends if you're the type of person who wants a new vehicle every 3 years and if you don't feel you've gotten use out of FSD in the time you've owned it. But if you own your vehicle between now and 2025, I'd find it pretty hard to believe you won't be getting value out of FSD. I'd be disappointed it hadn't reached L4 yet, sure, but if I'm getting value out of it? again who cares. Especially since by 2025 they'll probably be charging substantially more than just $10k for FSD.

Regardless one thing Tesla can do immediately to basically eliminate this fear is just ensure that FSD is accounted for when people are looking to trade it in for an upgraded Tesla (IF the trade-in has the hardware already). I personally think it's crazy talk when people say Tesla should give FSD free to early-adopters who upgrade their vehicle. I mean those early-adopters paid like $3k for FSD max, and it's currently worth $10k. IMO thats ridiculous for people to think that is an even trade. What is reasonably is maybe them valuing your vehicle an additional $2k-$3k (up to what you paid for FSD or slightly less).

I think if anyone wanted to sue Tesla for this they should do it now or never basically. As more features are released you are making it less likely you win anything."
mbetme,gs42ml8,"No, I'm believing what I see. There are FSD Beta testers driving Nav on City Streets. Now from what I can see it's still not great. But neither is Smart Summon, yet they delivered that. Is it good enough to release? Probably not quite. Will it be good enough for a customer-wide release 6 months from now after they've retrained it another 8-12 times? I think so... Once that is delivered they will have delivered on pretty much everything promised feature-wise out of your/others FSD purchase. Maybe the only thing not, is reverse Summon/ Smart Park? Either way I'll bet once they deliver this to all customers who own FSD they WILL say this is feature complete. Whether you like it or not. At that point they will recognize most (potentially even all) of the deferred Revenue they have remaining.

Same way they delivered AP, they will have delivered FSD. Regardless this thread is about Teslas risk exposure if it were brought to court. I think it's pretty safe to say that once they deliver the current Beta to all customers, they will have very minimal risk remaining.

And the last point I've been making is, EVEN IF you sell your vehicle a year from now, if you have really waited 3 years+ for FSD like you're making it out to be, that would mean you've only paid like $3k for the feature set. If they deliver the current Beta to you but like 2-3x better than what we are currently seeing, you'd have a pretty bad argument that you aren't getting a lot of value of of that purchase."
mbetme,grxo1xd,Meanwhile Elon is tweeting that [they're going to stop using radar](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1370522745709158407?s=20) altogether for FSD in April lol. So anybody's guess at this point.
mbetme,grxnvni,"That's not actually true. 

1. The only core function, relevant to roads and thus L3, that hasn't been attempted yet is pot hole avoidance. Which isn't really ""needed"" just highly valued. More will be needed for L4 though, at minimum a dedicated parking lot mode.

2. Sensor redundancy would be nice and would improve future car's performance, but isn't strictly needed. 

Side cams for lane changes can be supplemented by the ultrasonics. For turns if it can't see it can simply choose to abort and take a different route.

For front cameras it can, and already does as seen in some videos, simply slow down to give things more time to move out of the blinded area. 

This is also not to mention that technically all an L4/5 system has to be able to do is safely pull over if operation can't continue.


All that said I do expect better sensors to come eventually to newer cars. But as mentioned briefly earlier I think the effect will be better performance and or working in worse conditions, rather then strictly being needed for FSD at all."
mbetme,gs35zpd,"You're not understanding the original state of things.  Up until the switch mentioned below there was only every level 2 feature and a 100% complete FSD. 

Smart summon was EAP.  NoAP was EAP. City streets would have been EAP. 

Then they realized they couldn't recognize revenue that way and changed it.

https://www.currentautomotive.com/tesla-changes-autopilot-feature-availability/

Tesla dropped a bit of a bombshell yesterday, announcing the introduction of the Standard Range Model 3, a number of price and feature changes, and the transition to online sales only along with the closure of its retail stores.

Autopilot features have changed as a result of the announcement. Enhanced Autopilot is no longer available as an option, instead replaced with two options: Autopilot and Full Self Driving Capability.

The prices and available features have been adjusted as well. Enhanced Autopilot offered Adaptive Cruise Control, Autosteer, Summon, Autopark, and Navigate on Autopilot for a price of $6,000). The new Autopilot option only includes Adaptive Cruise Control and Autosteer, and is priced at $3,000 for the Model Y. It is standard on Model S, Model 3, and Model X."
mbetme,gsy3fob,"We agree. More information == better. Just a matter of cost and timing. Regarding lidar and ultrasonics, there is an interference argument against widespread use. 

To go back to your earlier message, I do think V2V communication and limited I2V (infrastructure to vehicle) communication is inevitable. It just makes sense that the cars ahead of me can advertise intent with something other than brake and signal lights."

No sane manufacturer will ever agree to these terms."
ey2s1r,fgj7qid,"As an EE who is a data storage specialist, I have issues with this analogy.

The ways in which SSDs have increased storage capacity have come at the expense of a tremendous reduction in life of the units.  First, we had SLC technology.  Each cell was either on or off, this storing one bit per cell.  Next came MLC, or multi-level cell.  Each cell in MLC devices stores two bits, but it does this by storing four different energy levels, which must be differentiated upon read.  Next, a technology called TLC comes out, which is actually kind of abuse of the name, since it actually stores three bits, or eight energy levels.  Now, quad-bit technology is becoming available, storing and differentiating 16 different energy levels in one cell.

As flash wears, the ability for each cell to hold a charge begins to change, rendering cells more susceptible to read disturb effects.  Additionally, increasing power is required to erase each block before its cells can be programmed.

The end result is that SLC flash might survive 800000-1.5 million P/E cycles, or how many times it can be written and erased.  MLC flash might survive 5000-10000 cycles.  TLC is hovering around 1000, with some cheap Chinese chips only making it 600, with better flash from Micron or Samsung claiming ratings.as high as 2000 in a lab environment.  QLC is basically garbage, with many QLC devices only able to be rewritten 300 times, and even Samsung's QVO series devices only claiming 500 cycles.

To translate that into numbers...

A 256 GB drive made with MLC technogy will be able to write about 1280 TB, conservatively, before it dies.  A TLC based unit might write 300 TB or so.  The QLC drive will likely be dead before 120 TB has been recorded, and possibly before even 100.

If you wanted to apply this approach to car batteries, and I am sure the bean counters at GM and their buddies at LG are looking hard at this, you can easily increase battery charge capacity at the expense of cycle life.  How much do you think is reasonable?  25-30% extra range, but a meaningfully pack lifetime of 120000 miles?  Hey, most cars are leased anyway now, so why not just start building junk?"

17smku5,k8qu6a6,I'm waiting for the day that Tesla finally admits that 202x or older teslas cannot fully utilize the final FSD version where self driving is actually in an acceptable state. Then you can expect owners to start filing lawsuits.
17smku5,k8r3s1x,"I agree. 2021 model y owner with FSD in the Netherlands here. There is no perceived benefit in using FSD. I think it is mostly due to law restrictions,  but I payed for it and it is useless,  nonetheless."
17smku5,k8rtsjb,"I paid ‚Ç¨7K for FSD and have still been waiting for my M3 2019.
I'm severely disappointed in Tesla."
17smku5,k8rnyzq,Bro you couldn't write this without ChatGPT? üò≠
17smku5,k8rqx4y,"Because it‚Äôs not ready, teslas model of it staying with the car is super awkward.

But because it‚Äôs already 7 years in waiting, It should have been a license that stays with the owner. Anyone who bought it when it was first available for purchase end of 2016 have clearly not enjoyed any of the promise and have likely moved on. The average car owner upgrades every 6 years."
17smku5,k8sj8bm,"If it‚Äôs worse in Europe than in the US, that‚Äôs sad. Just got my first Tesla this week and it came with 3 months of FSD from a referral deal. I‚Äôve played with it a little bit and holy cow is it scary. Seems to be a long way off from actually being usable."
17smku5,k8sv9n9,"Correct! I am biding my time til I do something about it. 

Scumrat and his red minions conned us all."
17smku5,k8tdfpx,"It definitely sucks, not sure you will be able to get a full refund for FSD without winning a massive lawsuit, which I feel is somewhat unlikely.  However, I do agree that it would be a good move by Tesla to offer free supercharging to early FSD adopters.

In addition, I am pretty sure Tesla and Elon himself have admitted that FSD is not fully there yet.  At least here in the US it is part of an agreement you sign if you purchase FSD.  As for making specific acknowledgements about Europe, I am not sure what you really expect from Tesla there.  Will they have to make public statements about every country where it may or may not work and specifically how much of it works in that country?  That doesn't seem tenable."
17smku5,k8rjlpv,Perhaps Tesla risk going bankrupt if they tried to refund all the FSD purchases?
17smku5,k8s4yxj,"I'd argue that the US and the rest of the world are no different. I have had FSD for years and it is crap. I use AP less than I used to because it has gotten worse over the years, not better."
17smku5,k8sblys,Camera blind spots such as the lower front bumper and lack of sensor diversity/contingency (no radar nor LiDAR) means Teslas will never be fully autonomous no matter how smart FSD software gets.
17smku5,ky62yh8,The problem is that you choose to continue to live in Europe
17smku5,k8u2cgb,"Or better yet.. don‚Äôt buy something that is not ready and has ‚Äúbeta‚Äù in its name. Not worth the 12k, not even 6k right now. 

People should just stop buying it and do a little research before making a purchase of that size and so trivial. That is the only thing that would change Tesla‚Äôs behavior in regard to self-driving. If people keep buying it then Tesla is not going to see a problem with it. That is how corporations work. They aren‚Äôt your friends or family and out there to be nice. They are in it to make money."
17smku5,k8rasbj,"I hate to say this but when FSD 12 is fully rolled out in the us it will come to UK next.  Expect the price to double.  Elon and the government are already planning full FSD legislation and expect within 5 years there will be a huge group of unemployed foreigners who do these taxis and delivery jobs.

The major globalist powers are already making plans, FSD is going to come and when it does it will be level 4-5 all at once."
17smku5,k8skq1v,another attempt by TSLAQ-barking dog seldom bite.
17smku5,k8wd5vh,"Every time a European posts about FSD, they should be required to pay me a nickel for the electricity it's going to take to get me to the doctor to treat my strained eyes from how hard they rolled at their ridiculous comments. 

Feature was delayed. You deserve nothing."
17smku5,k8r6v0g,Europe you say ? Here is an idea. Make a union. IF FSD. Then go on a strike. IF Metal and all other unions will join in. Tesla car owners get no baked goods. No hair cuts. No cafes. No train rides. No repairs. That‚Äôll show Tesla not to mess with Europe!
17smku5,k8u4yyj,"I asked for a refund last week through the app and still haven‚Äôt received a reply. M3 2019 and got free upgrade to HW3. Which broke after 1,5 years and they made me replace it because 1 year warranty. üôÉ"
17smku5,k8u5lt2,Totally agreeüíØ üíØ üíØ!! I am in the States and I just read of a guy in the UK who just got refunded his FSD purchase after suing Tesla! You guys have wayyyyy better protections for consumers in Europe than here! It is a TOTAL fraud..Musk had promised fsd since 2019...incredible!! Really wish we had these kinda protections here in the States to truly hold Tesla accountable for their utter BS!!
17smku5,k8uspqq,Tesla simply should‚Äôve just called it Autopilot and left it at that.  Maybe even called it ‚ÄúGlorified Cruise Control‚Äù but no they totally embellished it and now a class action is coming.
17smku5,karcch7,"I‚Äòve been waiting for this. I paid 7k for fsd for my 2020 model 3 in switzerland. Never got anything for it. Customers deserve their money back, honestly. Unfortunately there don‚Äòt seem to be any class action lawsuits in Europe. If anyone initiates anything on this I would join immediately."
17smku5,k8qw3o3,"I don't need a lawsuit. I need Tesla to allow unlimited 1:1 software feature and perk transfers to new Tesla purchases, at least until a current FSD owner has moved to an actual FSD capable vehicle."
17smku5,k8r7fzc,I‚Äôm betting they do a tiered like ‚ÄúFSD Basic / Plus / Prime‚Äù and just tell legacy owners what they were actually buying is the basic tier that‚Äôs little more than NoAP
17smku5,k8svj87,"I don't know about in the EU, but in the US everyone has an arbitration agreement with Tesla to prevent this. They just had a lawsuit dismissed over FSD missing features last month because of this.

https://www.reuters.com/legal/tesla-owners-must-arbitrate-false-advertising-claims-over-autopilot-feature-2023-10-02/"
17smku5,k8r5nj6,"Question: is your software different than the people that only have AP? I‚Äôm in the Netherlands too, but the speed limit detection and green light detection (beep when traffic light turns green) is not functioning 100%. I would get  thousands a month in fines for the Tesla not recognising speed limits and not recognising which lane corresponds to which traffic light if it would semi-self drive with this quality of software.

Apart from the software issues, with current hardware (2023 model 3) it can‚Äôt even do the AP functions properly in the current weather (rainy!) we‚Äôre having. There is absolutely 0 chance they will be able to deliver the FSD promises with current hardware. Weather conditions should have to be perfect to use them. I also don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs ever going to park itself in the small parking spaces we have here. The camera parking sensors are a joke."
17smku5,k8rfdmb,"Seems like it's going forward but slowly.

Im not relying on a tweet for confirmation. üôÇ"
17smku5,k8snpyv,Ikr lol creating the prompt probably took more effort
17smku5,k8roylh,I'm lazy!!!!
17smku5,k8ruc35,"Nearly every other software license works this way, licensed to the owner. This would be a great way to make Tesla owners to stay with the brand. The way it is now doesn‚Äôt really build loyalty."
17smku5,kard6ja,"Definitely not. Say 1 million tesla customers got 10k back for their fsd purchase (it‚Äòs way less for both numbers), that would be 10 billion. Tesla has around 20 billion in cash and adding another 2 or 3b in cash every quarter. They also have a high market cap at which they can easily raise way more capital. Tesla has zero financial problem to make this right by customers."
17smku5,kardrcy,Do you believe humans can drive a car without front bumper sensor diversity/ contingency (no radar/LiDAR)?
17smku5,k8s4suw,This is some hardcore tinfoil shit man.
17smku5,k8rbcdc,"I don't disagree that FSD will come and might impact job security. A lot of ifs and buts, but it might happen. 

However, all of the ifs and buts aside, in eu the current state of fsd is that is doesnt work at all. 

I did see some bmw enhanched cruise control video, where in Germany apparently more is allowed. Quite promising!"
17smku5,k8rfadq,Add about 3 to 5 more years to that but yea.
17smku5,k8slfaz,"TSLAQ - now I know it exists lol, nope, if Tesla would be honest it would not sell FSD at all in the regions where must be disabled"
17smku5,k8rpq26,Yeah you have no idea what the situation in Sweden  is about
17smku5,k8r7muh,">No hair cuts.

üò≥"
17smku5,k8qwrow,"This not being the case currently is most of the reason why I won't get FSD at any price. I'm already against paying to collect data for a beta product, but if I know I can keep it for life, that gets me a lot farther."
17smku5,k8rjth9,You know the EU regulations are the limitations here right?
17smku5,k8rbfuy,Problem is they've already defined the features they must deliver. It's too late to change the goalposts at this point. Doing as such is simply failing to deliver.
17smku5,k8r8ygc,"Agree on the parking sensors/cameras. I personally think it is fair that weather can have influence on ability to use AP or FSD. This has been a challenge in aviation for a long time, as well.

Biggest challenges regarding AP in the Netherlands for me are:
-AP (or driving without ap for that matter) cannot handle our 60kmh roads with white lines on the side. It will steer correct like crazy with loud beeping sounds at brake whenever there is a car heading in the other direction. 
-highways like a50 with lanes that can open or close, depending on traffic (spitslanen). AP cannot handle the diagonal lines on the right most lane. It will steer and beep and go crazy. Or if you are in the second lane it will think the truck driving in the first lane will move into the second lane. And it will brake. Also it cannot move in or out first lane, because of de 'doorgetrokken streep'.
-on a regular highway when driving in the first (right most) lane and you are passing an upramp, it will sometimes brake when a car moves from the upramp to the first lane, behind you. As a result the car joining traffic needs to brake. 
-orange blinking lights will trigger brake. 
-auto lane change takes waaaaay too long and does weird steering corrections on and off. 
-auto lane change takes too much input on steering wheel to confirm you want to make the lane change. Sometimes this disables AP. 

Now regarding FSD: you can choose to engage some form of automated navigation, when you start a trip.  Instead of blue lines on the side of the road you now see a blue line from the middle of the car. When it nears a car or truck up front it will ask you if you want to change lanes. You need to confirm this with first your indicator and second a steering wheel whobble. This whole process takes way too long. So it will brake. And now your speed to pass a truck joining traffic on second lane is reduced. And it will have a really hard time trying to find a spot in second lane. 

The second thing it can do is dort of automatically take an offramp, based on your navigation destination. But here you also need to confirm with both blinker and steering whobble. This takes too long, so it might miss the exit. 

So, in essence, fsd in NL is useless."
17smku5,k8r7jra,do you have 2023 M3 Highland?
17smku5,k8rmfjd,Elon stated in the latest Q3 that they will not rollout FSD for other countries than USA due to regulamentory issues. Please go watch it again.
17smku5,k8rre2t,"There's already so much bots on Reddit, don't be one yourself if you are not one already. AI will be a pest and ruin the genuine Reddit experience. Not trying to be pragmatic but I'm already tired of those bullet points posts, it feels so unnatural."
17smku5,k8saymu,No car software works like that tho
17smku5,kav3i8d,"Great that they are so cash rich but morally poor. If they have so rich then why not refund their customers who do not wish to wait longer for FSD, Summons or auto-park?"
17smku5,k8thco6,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12719949/Driverless-cars-buses-delivery-lorries-UK-roads-2030.html
17smku5,k8qymz8,"Yup.  Nothing like buying fsd, totaling the car, and losing the 12k for software.  If it transfers, thats a different story."
17smku5,k8u69kd,üíØüíïüíïüíØüíØ!! It is a beta product!! & What makes this so egregious is they don't even allow customers transfer it to a new vehicle!! They want you to purchase this gimmick again to put in a new carüò±üò±üò±üò±
17smku5,k8rpkpa,"No, the limitations are fsd not living up to run standards and regulations."
17smku5,k8svld1,"I work in this area, and it is not the rules, it is the fulfillment of safety standards of the product. Tesla is so far behind Mercedes and VW and BMW here in the EU because they won't put their ego down for a second to realize you can't get around the regulator with a tweet or lie."
17smku5,k8u7gaj,Huh? BS!! FSD isn't ready for prime time! EU regs has zero to do with that. If that were true..people in the US wouldn't have any issues with it .and it would be truly FSD .it's clearly not!!
17smku5,k8sk8qw,"Interesting. I was on a trip to the Netherlands early last month and met none of these challenges, heck, in some of the nastier weather the car saw better than me. I don't recall a single problem with lane recognition or someone merging.

Which part of the Netherlands are you from, cause it would be quite interesting to see what local differences there seem to be between different parts of the country (we came into the country through Germany and went to Amsterdam from the north by driving on A7 (we lived north of amsterdam) and the later returned and went to Amsterdam through A6)"
17smku5,k8r83rm,No previous version from this summer.
17smku5,k8rmyfc,"This is beside the point. Regulation will have to be in place before expansion of the FSD program.

As of now this seems to be January 2025."
17smku5,k8vhmon,"I'm not native in English, so I prefer to write a prompt with main points and AI just polish the post, so it's not written by AI, just enhanced."
17smku5,kav9ldc,Completely agreed. They have no good reason not to pay. I am about to ask my FSD money back.
17smku5,k8ticf3,"Daily Mail lol

The journey your brain took from this article to the conclusions in your post is frightening."
17smku5,k8u1ng2,If you total the car would the 12k be a part of the price for car replacement by the insurance company?
17smku5,k8sdnc5,I probably would buy it if it becomes transferable.
17smku5,k8sj70s,"Currently, no matter how good it may be or become (even if it theoretically was perfect) it would no be allowed on EU roads. So yes, the regulations are what is blocking use of FSD in the EU. And even if it became perfect tommorow, it wouldn't be allowed for a long, long time here, cause the EU is notoriously behind on EV and auto law changes in general (until earlier this year it was illegal for an EV to have the brake lights on when regenerating, no matter how fast it was slowing down as an example)."

17smku5,k8u7i8c,Preach!!!!üíïüíïüíØüíØ
17smku5,k8uxpf6,"Fuck this, German sucking only on German teet here. The Merc, VW, BMW tech and software is so damn shitty. Regulations will hold Tesla back until VW catches up and gets regulators to allow it, so they have a chance. Germans boxing out anyone they can to pretend to be near the front. The hell do I need to physically control something that doesn't need controlling. Oh moving the eyes counts now! Good job VW, suddenly regulators allow that. Not Tesla's solid implementation for the last 5 years though. German car companies are still 10 years behind Tesla."
17smku5,k8u8mh1,Thank you!!! Spot on!! And we all know where the ego is emanating from!!
17smku5,k8t8v1p,"I can confirm that going from Winschoten a7, through 'de polder' to Amsterdam, the AP can handle it really well. If you go more down south and go onto the a50 after Zwolle and head towards Arnhem and beyond, this is where ap gets confused. I do this route every week and have 70k on my model y using this route. 

Overall I am pretty happy with AP! I would not want a daily car without a similar system,  anymore. 

But I wouldnt mind the glitches to be fixed. And in the current state I could totally do without fsd, because it is very little more than AP, in the Netherlands."
17smku5,k8rnrtw,"No it is not. Tesla doesn't follow standard validation plans for safety systems. Their driving assistance SW and HW are not ASIL D compliant... There is no safety redundancy, only 1 system is operating. They need a minimum of 2 cameras per spot with washing systems or other sensoring elements to replace at least 1 of the camaras when it fails

I cannot understand how USA road safety allows an incomplete system and not validated system in the road.

For example, a common braking system has 2 or more pressure and position sensors to read driver input and brake output. Same for accelerators, steering systems and so on. This is industry standard for at least 2 decades."
17smku5,k8u6ycg,Hell nooo
17smku5,k8sz4yk,"As it currently stands, there is no reason for it not to be except as an attempt to extract more money out of the consumers. Tying it to VIN only is completely arbitrary. 

I suppose there's the argument that they want to avoid people with a fleet of teslas just sharing one FSD account and swapping in the fly as needed, but that's easily fixable too; maybe make a cool down period from transferring your license to another car. A day, a week, something like that. 

I suppose they'd also argue that they don't want to set precedent with software addons like acceleration boost, but again, it's such an arbitrary ""we just want to push you into spending more"" mentality that it keeps me from wanting to spend at all. I don't even want to pay the monthly trial."
17smku5,k8sjo4o,"No tesla want to push a sub par product without proper safety measures that the regulations require.

Tesla want people to pay to beta test so they can get $$$

If they really wanted to push their fsd and if it was perfect they would just follow the regulations and requirements.

This is just tesla making themselves a victim of ""big evil EU"" because they don't want to actually follow rules."
17smku5,k8u88gs,For good reason!! The EU are NOT fooled by the Elon/Tesla BS!! They see through all that smoke n mirrors!! BTW same here..NHTSA will NOT allow FSD to be fully functional on roads for a long long LONG time! Count on it
17smku5,k8sd0na,"No, regulations aren't an issue, the issue is that tesla can't meet the standards."
17smku5,k8t9dmq,"Interesting taht it's so different from place to place in the Netherlands. I haven't really been anywhere but the amsterdam area, but is there a major difference in the way lane markings and roads are made from place to place?

I'm not trying to say AP is flawless, cause it most certainly isn't. I merely find it fascinating to see what causes it to nail some situations while failing in others."
17smku5,k8rs7gh,"‚ÄúI cannot understand how USA‚Ä¶‚Äù

17smku5,k8socfv,"‚ÄúI cannot understand how USA road safety allows an incomplete system‚Äù - well, FSD killed zero people despite hundreds of thousands of Teslas use it, unlike regular autopilot, which has been approved even in Europe."

17smku5,k8skiyw,"No. Currently, no self driving car would be legal in the EU. That is a fact. A car is not allowed to make a lane change without user input, no matter how good at it it might be.

So no. No matter how good any self driving software might be coming out tommorow, it wouldn't be allowed on EU roads."

17smku5,k8u7opc,üíïüíïüíïüëè
17smku5,k8tad16,"Pretty interesting indeed! Yes the biggest difference is that on the a50 you have 3 lanes. But the right most lane is only openened at specifics instances. And the main issue is that it has a solid white line as a border to the second lane. So usually this means you cannot cross this line. But as exeptions go, if the overhead matrix signs state the lane is opnened, you are allowed to cross this solid line. AP doesnt seem to get this. 

Another issue is the diagonal line on that same lane that acts as an ending of upramp, in situations when the lane is not opened. However, when the lane is opened and you drive there with your AP, AP follows thqt diagonal line and gets very confused and disengages."
17smku5,k8ro927,"I agree.

I work in the industry for the EU market. I am quite sure Tesla will have to modify several things to be able to have something sellable equal or above FSAE level 3."
17smku5,k8uudoe,"Of course it cannot kill. It disconnects seconds before a crash.

I don't know if you are aware, but pick up your tesla in a normal spring/summer day and activate FSD, then roll both front windows down. Put your (driver) left arm outside. Then your passanger does the same but for the right arm. Both wave the arms and then the guy that triggers a fake avoidance maneuvre wins. The passanger wins, when the car swerves into incoming traffic, the driver wins when the car swerves out of the road. You should try it...

FSD is Autopilot in highways and speedways, the SW switchs automatically btw both.

Edit: I worked and work for many OEMs. Although I like some Tesla's powertrains, however it is negligent how they handle safety systems."
17smku5,k8slscs,"Because bo self driving car is safe, and no current system should currently be allowed.

I don't trust any current system to do safe lane change.

Probably in the future there has to be a change in regulations sure. But until we see actual working self drive systems that are safe I rather see a ban on them all.

Cause when an inferior system is out in public usage and shit happens it hurts the whole future of that system.

In theory I support self driving as soon as it's safer than humans but unfortunately how we as a species work it needs to be near bulletproof for it to be accepted otherwise people will fight it.

Currently there is not a single autonomous system that is generally safer than humans and having these testing put in traffic is not helping this.

But tesla doesn't actually care about development or humans they just want $$$"
17smku5,k8ucww5,Except obviously the Merc that is
17smku5,k8sitz8,How are the regulations the issue? They are their to protect the consumer...
17smku5,k8rorn6,"I hope they don't split up the proposal into driver initiated and system initiated commands. 
It's better to wait for another ""cycle"" and get everything approved at the same time.

For now we are stuck with Drive Pilot as a marketing stunt approved manually on a situational basis."
17smku5,k8wbda8,"there are several documented fatalities of basic autopilot, doesn‚Äôt matter if it disconnected seconds before crash or not. There are zero FSD fatalities. If there were, journalists would be all over it.  
  
Luckily, no one plays waving hands game. Even though FSD would kill you on its own, it seems that people are responsible enough to not kill themselves. These are the facts based on statistics.  
  
Feel free to disprove me by any documented case.  
  
FSD no longer switch to basic autopilot on highways, since I think beginning of the year.  
  
If you don‚Äôt like how Tesla handles safety, you would love my Mercedes EQE. When it loses lanes, it disconnects without any visual warning or any sound. Just the color of wheel icon turns from green to gray"
17smku5,k8sm7w6,"So, in conclusion, as I've said, self driving is not allowed in the EU, from anyone. No matter how good it might be.

That is to say, it doesn't matter how capable a system is, it is no allowed. As such, it is the regulations holding beta from the EU, not the capability (though there has been moves to allow something similar to FSD, but slightly less capable, to be used while monitored on EU roads this year)"
17smku5,k8udbnj,"That gimmick? Yes, but still under heavy restrictions, due to which it's no more useful than a level 2."
17smku5,k8sj1yr,It‚Äôs what‚Äôs stopping Tesla from delivering fsd. Works great in the us. It doesn‚Äôt protect the consumer
17smku5,k8wopvt,"I don't know if you know how FSD works on highways or speedways. It jumps automatically for Autopilot while on FSD without any warning. It is just an algorithm switch without you being aware.

I already saw 2 FSD crashes due to heavy sun reflections and no warning sent to the driver. The car jist veered of the road into ditches.

Regarding the waving arms. It is common/normal people have their arms out of the car and move them. A system needs to be better, a simple reading of other sensoring system would overlap the bad camara reading.

Regarding EQE, that system is not claiming ""FSD"" (I believe probably you removed the warning chime on the settings, by mistake). If you have their limited level 3 autonomy it even warns you and the other people in the road and on foot when the system is activitated.

In my honest professional opinion, Tesla will need more sensoring devices to jump for further levels and they will have 0 data of that sensoring elements in Dojo due to the option of vision only as cost solution, rather than form and function solution.

IMO, autonomy should be reached in buses or taxis first, because you can ammortize the system cost by 24/7 per passanger, not in personal cars. I would be expecting automated driving only for expensive and exclusive cars only.

Although I think that the electric powertrain is the future, I also think that big battery BEVs are not the solution (that should belong to hybrids), but rather small to medium battery packs BEVs that can handle fast charges (due to weight, tire and road wear, bridges and car parks are not design for the full weight of big batteries, also due to insurance high costs for totalling big battery packs for minor fender benders)"
17smku5,k8uehwg,So is it legal?
17smku5,k8ssrsz,"No it doesn‚Äôt! I‚Äôm in the US and it‚Äôs not a functioning product. It‚Äôs unreliable. Doesn‚Äôt recognize road lines. And one time on an off ramp mine told me it was going right with right blinker on and car went left! Absolutely not a functioning feature.

Remember it‚Äôs supervised, so you are still supposed to be making the final decisions on how it drives."
1cd3aqx,l19cgx0,Highway is still V11. The new V12 stack is only used outside of highways right now.
1cd3aqx,l19s78n,"My ""Too human"" observation is the lack of ability for it to make up its mind at stop signs."
1cd3aqx,l19y4ew,"My biggest pet peeve is its indecisiveness when changing lanes. V12 will start to change a lane, get 50% then straighten out, then continue and complete the lane change. I have seen human drivers do this (my guess is they are trying to occupy two lanes when they dont know which one will end up being faster) but fsd has learned it and does it from time to time."
1cd3aqx,l1am6jz,This guys views the left lane like the restricted section in the Hogwarts library
1cd3aqx,l1ahwax,"They didn't ""program"" it. 

They programmed a neural net and then fed it real drivers behavior to train it."
1cd3aqx,l19zg1k,Ive noticed that it‚Äôs a lot better about getting back out of the left lane on Average or Chill. I havent had issues with getting up to speed while entering the highway but I definitely experience the slow down before exiting. I usually have to give it a little throttle to offset the behavior
1cd3aqx,l1cws7w,Good points!   I also noticed these in the beginning but I changed the driving style to Assertive and that helped at least #2 and #3 on your list.   I feel like it still does #1.
1cd3aqx,l1a5kyg,"The downside of using the most cautious drivers is that they're ridiculously cautious, even to the point of causing problems."
1cd3aqx,l1a4qts,I would assume the errors that you‚Äôre describing are actually not human like at all.
1cd3aqx,l1agc2y,I can‚Äôt stand the super early stops and then super slow creep. I also notice it‚Äôs not very good at telling if it‚Äôs at a 4 way stop or if it‚Äôs just you with a stop.
1cd3aqx,l1alh6t,"For issues 1 and 3, you have to remember that Highway FSD is on the v11 stack.  You can tell because the blue path is longer than when you‚Äôre in v12.  

Have to see those scenarios play out when highway is updated to v12"
1cd3aqx,l1aly8k,All of your issues is because highway is still on V11 stack and have general issues with slow down and phantom braking on slow lanes around exists. This this is V11 behavior and not V12; should improve when highway is also on V12‚Äôstack.
1cd3aqx,l1ayw94,"I just hate that even though I tell it what to do, like make a lane change, it doesn‚Äôt; when I want to slow it down to go around a corner, I can‚Äôt, why? Because it disengages the moment I put my foot on the break. Can I set the speed on the dial, sure, but then that limits me not being able to use the auto speed‚Ä¶ so a lot of caveats even though it‚Äôs ‚Äúsupervised‚Äù but yet giving me restrictions to supervise it.

I really really love FSD on a main freeway, in traffic especially; however, I noticed it takes way too long to make a lane change and/or goes to make it then circles back in the lane which is ultimately super dangerous. So I feel more comfortable disengaging and making the lane changes. The lane changes are horrible‚Ä¶ often, too many times, the car SLOWS down to make a lane change instead of speeds up, it doesn‚Äôt this when the lane it is changing to doesn‚Äôt even have oncoming traffic‚Ä¶"
1cd3aqx,l1ch1hz,For me it requires so much more attention than simple auto steer that I only used the trial for a couple weeks. I've been back on auto steer now and I can't imagine going back to fsd any time soon. I thought I might pay the $100 for a month if I had a long trip coming up. But I just don't think I would want to do that.
1cd3aqx,l1cinln,Idk I just had my FSD slam the brakes as I was just about to go through an intersection that just turned yellow. Freaked me out
1cd3aqx,l1cstbd,"Drifting back and forth along the center line while waiting for a safe window to pass someone, as if acting impatient. Fuck that's annoying."
1cd3aqx,l1d78l6,Is Tesla using FSD v12 on the highway now? Because from the description a few weeks ago it seemed like v12 was only for city streets and highway was still using an older system.
1cd3aqx,l1a0irq,"Don‚Äôt have V12 yet, and may never get it as I‚Äôm the 24.8.xx stuff‚Ä¶but‚Ä¶

Does it still ‚Äúcreep forward for visibility‚Äù cause I‚Äôm almost 100% certain I saw someone get rear ended yesterday as a result. And it‚Äôs exactly why I disengage it at quite a few stop signs‚Ä¶thing works perfect for stoplights though."
1cd3aqx,l1ag3p0,[deleted]
1cd3aqx,l19yrkd,From 2 years now using the system I would add that the highway activity is very much still v11 in disguise. It was good enough for me to drive accross the country coast to coast without issue but it's not as human like as city streets. I think relying 100% on neural nets for highway is a bit scary when highways require more strict rules for safety. I would give it another few months for highway to get more neural control
1cd3aqx,l1acq1z,"Hopefully it gets better but at the present, it‚Äôs not worth the price. Also, monthly payments do not count towards the cost of permanently owning it."
1cd3aqx,l1as7qr,"If that human is a 16 year old new driver driving in a major metropolitan city they've never been before, sure."
1cd3aqx,l1dr56u,"lol. Programmers are not training by driving. It‚Äôs your driving that‚Äôs training it. So, if most people behave they way, so will the car"
1cd3aqx,l19ls28,"Yeah that‚Äôs what I end up doing too. 
Just mildly annoying I guess. Like in my mind the left lane should just be used for specific situations, like passing someone. It should default to the center or right (if no center) unless there is a specific thing it needs to do in the left lane. Seems like an easy programming thing."
1cd3aqx,l19eqru,"It's used on state highways and is considerably worse than v11 was. Tailgates frequently, can't maintain set speed, & wonders all over the lane. Like OP says, these things should be easy. And what's really frustrating is that they worked on v11."
1cd3aqx,l19m69g,"Sorry, think you misunderstood. I just meant it was my initial impression of FSD (only ever had basic autopilot until trial), not my impression of the newest version."
1cd3aqx,l19woy2,"It was a bit better with stop signs before nhtsa made a big deal about rolling stops. Now i notice it stops before the sign, then moves forward so you (and the car) can see if anyone is coming down the lane, then it enters the lane. Effectively it comes to a full stop twice because of where technically you are supposed to stop for a stop sign."
1cd3aqx,l1a4w0u,"Yup, probably my biggest issue right now. That and it slamming on the brakes for yellow lights it can easily go through. Still, V12 is so much better than V11.

Edit: Sounds like the lane change hesitancy is fixed in V12.4: https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1783673703647346994"
1cd3aqx,l19z6ip,"I call it ‚Äúsnake‚Äù behavior. Annoys me too, hopefully it‚Äôll be patched soon"
1cd3aqx,l1ar0e1,"Lol yes, I‚Äôm pretty close to that."
1cd3aqx,l1eimit,You‚Äôre not supposed to camp in the left lane haha
1cd3aqx,l1c2oel,This explains why it always wants to be in the left lane.
1cd3aqx,l1at8m3,There‚Äôs got to be some type of framework though. Real drivers result in 40k+ fatalities a year in the US alone so you can‚Äôt really base your whole system on them.
1cd3aqx,l1a5nwd,They are exactly what human drivers do constantly where I live. Drives me crazy. Let me know where you live if no dummies camp in the left lane. I‚Äôd consider moving there!
1cd3aqx,l1daw05,Nope. Not on the highway yet to my knowledge.
1cd3aqx,l1a7s5i,Yes it still creeps out very slowly depending on the situation. I‚Äôve had it creep out nearly half way into the street before it went even though there was clear line of sight for me at the stop sign. I‚Äôm curious to see if that gets better.
1cd3aqx,l1baglu,Surely you‚Äôre not blaming FSD because some idiot human rear ended it?
1cd3aqx,l1asso6,The human behavior is what I naively hoped FSD could eventually eliminate!
1cd3aqx,l1badb5,"I just took two Teslas out in a new city I‚Äôve never been before, enabled FSD and they did an amazing job. I am incredibly impressed."
1cd3aqx,l1e0q6b,Not saying they are physically driving it to train - I‚Äôm saying there is 100% a human programmer providing the FSD with SOME framework for how a car operates on a road. Example: the Tesla does not just stop at red lights because a majority of drivers did so during the ‚Äútraining.‚Äù Someone told the system at some point that a red light means stop. There are doubtless many other scenarios where things like that were inputted.
1cd3aqx,l19mp63,"Mine did the same thing around the eclipse time - I went on a 14 hour drive using FSD and noticed the same things- but after two software updates since then, it started moving back to the right lane, especially if somebody was coming up behind me. It‚Äôll get better, I hope.

The speed thing does bother me, though. Often on non-highway driving, it starts going below the speed limit. I use the accelerator, and it stays at the right speed for a little, but then drifts back down. 

Doesn‚Äôt matter to me any more. Somebody crashed into me on Monday and it‚Äôll be 2 months before I get my car back. And I lose the last 10 days of FSD.

Never mind me, I‚Äôm just looking for pity."
1cd3aqx,l1akhty,"Where I live, no one really follows this rule. The left lane is reserved for the faster driving cars. It‚Äôs completely normal to stay in that lane"
1cd3aqx,l1cjth6,On V11 if it was in the left lane and another car was approaching behind me it would move over to allow them to pass. I haven‚Äôt really had an opportunity to test that on V12 yet.
1cd3aqx,l1akfl4,"I disagree. If everyone stayed in the right lanes like you suggest, traffic would be even worse in cities. We need more lanes and equal cars in every lane. We live in a 3D world and essentially travel in 2D. Doesn‚Äôt make sense."
1cd3aqx,l19k5jb,"I agree with all this. 

It's pretty good at getting out of the way of tailgaters now. Although, that could be an old feature."
1cd3aqx,l19pp30,"V12 is enabled on certain state highways, yeah. I find it to be generally better than V11 on those. Yes, it doesn't robotically stay exactly centered in the lane and maintain the exact set speed, which in some situations is worse, but it behaves more naturally and is better overall IMO. And obviously on streets it's a million times better."
1cd3aqx,l1alyc7,"I've found it'd good at tailgating (not doing it) but find it goes slightly left then right over and over within the lane and it's like there's a terrible wind, when there isn't."
1cd3aqx,l19puit,"Oh my bad. Still, I think it's important to understand that on most divided highways, it's using a much older and less advanced software stack."
1cd3aqx,l1agjk0,I also think it can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs a 4 way stop or not. At least I never see it render the other stop signs
1cd3aqx,l1b33br,[deleted]
1cd3aqx,l1b3k5l,"I think a lot of that comes to dataset labeling/autolabeling, and any other relevant parts of the training. Learning how people drive a scenario without accidents, rather than just learning how most people drive it."
1cd3aqx,l1cr84h,"Despite what other Canadians say about Quebec drivers being super aggressive, we keep right except to pass. I've been telling people FSD drives like a Yank."
1cd3aqx,l1a68kx,"Well I will say it seems when I have the aggressive setting selected on the lane changes for FSD it does not try and camp in the left lane. 

Haven‚Äôt tried other settings but I will say it does embarrassing things that no human would choose regularly."
1cd3aqx,l1a9eua,"Yea, seems to be a limitation of the cameras and the angles. A wider lensed camera MAY fix some of that struggle so it gets a better view. 

What seemed dangerous to me (with the likely risk of being rear ended) is the start/stop nature of it ‚Äúcreeping forward‚Äù. Someone will think you‚Äôre ‚Äúgoing‚Äù then, accelerate right into you after autopilot ‚Äústops again‚Äù. 

I also wish it was more predictive in its planning. The result of sensors and data or even coding is it‚Äôs not REALLY AI‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not planning, or even thinking. It‚Äôs reacting to what it sees, which is how you ‚Äúlearn‚Äù to drive‚Ä¶but it shouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúhow you drive‚Äù. Least not if you‚Äôre remotely decent at it."
1cd3aqx,l1c57xj,"I‚Äôm a firm believer that if you rear-end a car, you‚Äôre at fault‚Ä¶whether you were following to closely, or not paying attention when a light changes. 

Same time, I will inform my children exactly why you SHOULDNT creep forward and stop multiple times at a light on a right turn‚Ä¶as it‚Äôs a way to get yourself rear ended."
1cd3aqx,l1e4zuy,"That‚Äôs the thing. That is how it used to be prior to v12. Staring v12, in the city stack, the neural nets are trained by video data only. The ‚Äúif / else‚Äôs‚Äù are now simply parameters to a Neural net that is learning what to do at a red light through trial and error."
1cd3aqx,l1b76vl,"OMG!  You lost the last 10 days of FSD!  Call Elon, get him on the phone now!  I pity you."
1cd3aqx,l1cp6rv,"Just because you live in an area with a lot of bad drivers doesn't mean that FSD should emulate bad drivers.  Tons of people don't use turn signals.  They're bad drivers and FSD SHOULD use turn signals despite them.  Some people roll through stop signs, doesn't mean FSD should.

FSD should emulate competent drivers, not shitty ones, regardless of how common the shitty drivers are in some regions."
1cd3aqx,l1ck9am,"But it should be already moved over, that‚Äôs the problem. If it‚Äôs not, what will happen sometimes is the car approaching will start moving to the right to pass the dummy hanging in the left, likely at the same time the computer finally decides to move Tesla to the correct lane."
1cd3aqx,l1asa4c,"You might be right for some high traffic areas. And if all cars on the road were controlled by the same autopilot computer I‚Äôd agree in theory too. But if you‚Äôre on a podunk highway and no one is in the right lane and you‚Äôre chilling in the left, you‚Äôre doing it wrong."
1cd3aqx,l1ad7a1,on highways why would you not want it to maintain a set speed in the exact center?
1cd3aqx,l1c6ria,"It def can tell a 4 way stop, atleast in my area"
1cd3aqx,l1chl1h,Not all distracted and drunk though - plenty are caused by poor decision-making and/or not knowing the proper rules of the road.
1cd3aqx,l1e7j2j,Well even if that is true that v12 has literally zero if-then situations (god help us all if that‚Äôs the case) highway is all I‚Äôm talking about and that‚Äôs v11.
1cd3aqx,l1ccr2w,Perfect. That‚Äôs just what I needed.
1cd3aqx,l1cq38m,I don‚Äôt think that makes you a bad driver. There are plenty of states that don‚Äôt follow that rule.
1cd3aqx,l1cks7c,The specific scenario I mentioned from V11 was a decent amount of traffic but all moving at full speed so moving over after each vehicle passed would be excessive lane changes. It was making multiple passes and remained in the left lane to continue passing until there was a large enough gap with another vehicle approaching from behind then it moved over. Exactly how I would have done it.
1cd3aqx,l1ariv5,"Sometimes you do want it to robotically maintain the exact set speed. But sometimes you don't, because it's not right for the situation. Some examples of those cases:

* Traffic around you is flowing much faster or slower than the set speed

* You need to exceed the set speed to pass someone

* You need to go a different speed from the set speed to get out of someone's blind spot

* The set speed is based on an incorrect speed limit reading

There isn't as much reason to not be robotically centered in the lane, but there's still some situations where you shouldn't:

* There's a parked car on the side of the road

* Part of the lane has rough pavement or debris

* You want to give more space to vehicles in an adjacent lane"
1cd3aqx,l1ammig,"You want auto speed because map data is occasionally wrong or confused and shows a much lower speed limit than what it actually is. This is one common source of phantom braking. 

People are not comfortable when the car is next to a semi and human drivers would naturally lean to the side that is away from the semi to give them more space. People complaint about earlier iterations of FSD specifically because it didn‚Äôt do this."
1cd3aqx,l1fk9ta,[deleted]
1cd3aqx,l1ehjbg,"I hear you on being scared about not hanging in control over the code in v12. But this is how all software 2 systems will be done in the future. Not just Tesla. So, the sooner we understand how to guardrail it the better. And I hope the fact that Tesla plans to unleash millions of cars on public roads with software 2 in control will probably mean we will get those guard rails sooner (compared to if only chatGPT was doing that )

I also agree that v11 highway stack feels unusable (esp compared to v12 city stack) 

I guess I actually agree with op, I just wanted to make the point that programmers are not ‚Äúdriving‚Äù that‚Äôs all."
1cd3aqx,l1cowc6,Real solution:  Have whoever hit you pay out an extra $100 for a month of full self driving like you were supposed to get.
1cd3aqx,l1d419d,">I don‚Äôt think that makes you a bad driver.

Well, bad drivers often aren't self aware and don't think that driving badly makes them a bad driver.  Just because bad drivers aren't aware that they're bad drivers doesn't mean they're not in fact, bad drivers (they are).  Also just because you can do something without technically breaking the law doesn't mean you're not a bad driver.

My state it's illegal to stay in the left lane on a highway for over 2 miles.  If I rode in the left lane every 1.9 miles, moved right, then moved back left, I'd still be a bad driver.  I stick right when I'm not passing.  I'm also aware of what's behind me before going to the left lane.  If the car ahead of me is going 2mph slower than me and someone in the left lane is going 10mph faster than me, I wait for them to go by before passing the car ahead of me (also I get by faster and don't pass people while maintaining a 2mph speed differential).

Pass and get over.  Most of the highway congestion I see is due to left lane campers and snail racing (I've literally seen an 18 wheeler move to the left lane while doing 45mph in a 65 or 70mph zone).

TL;DR: Bad drivers are still bad drivers even if they don't think they are and even if they're in an area with a lot of other bad drivers."
1cd3aqx,l1ckypc,That makes sense. I‚Äôd be good with that!
1cd3aqx,l1avtrd,"all of this is understandbale for FSD(not supervised, go to sleep) but for FSD(Supervised), the fact that i‚Äôve read many reddit reports that it will EXCEED your set speed is fucking idiotic and makes FSD completely useless for me.

Atleast until Tesla is willing to take all liability for any speed cameras or tickets which will never happen on Supervised. 

Autopilot will go below the set speed for all of these things you‚Äôve mentioned except a blind spot. On curves, if surrounding traffic is significantly slower etc.

If will also move out of the exact center for parked cars about 70% of the time."
1cd3aqx,l1aqfll,"oh yeah 100% about the speed limit being wrong.

Does FSD still not read ‚ÄúEND Speed limit 35‚Äù as the jurisdictional implied speed limit and instead as another Speed limit 35 sign?

Autopilot does this and it‚Äôs super annoying. Especially when map data has the correct limit"
1cd3aqx,l1fn2p1,"So the AI just magically knows what decisions are the good ones and what are the bad ones? I would love to believe this, but there‚Äôs just no way that‚Äôs possible. Some bad decisions driving are made by the majority of drivers."
1cd3aqx,l1eita2,"My hope would be the learning would have more to do with what it sees and not what drivers are deciding to do. Human drivers in general are really, really bad at driving. It would be like programming a calculator with a 1st grader‚Äôs math answers."
1cd3aqx,l1cxqz6,"I‚Äôll add it into the claim as ‚Äúpain and suffering,‚Äù because of the intense sadness I‚Äôm feeling."
1cd3aqx,l1b0e4c,"No, it's useful for supervised FSD too. Set speed changes prior to V12 were a very common and annoying source of interventions, and now they're basically gone. Keep in mind that this is a setting. You can still choose to set a max speed that FSD will never exceed. But they now have an option to have no max speed (besides the 50% above speed limit max that the NHTSA seems to be enforcing), which allows it to behave more like a human driver, and that's a very good thing in my experience. I've used V12 a lot at this point and there's never been a time where I felt it was going way too fast. Sometimes it accelerates too fast or picks a cruise speed that's a bit too fast for my liking, but it's never way too fast. This is much better than the unnatural max speed based on a percentage offset from the detected speed limit that existed before.

Also, no, Autopilot would not go below the set speed for the items I mentioned. It would if an adjacent lane is going much slower than the set speed, but that's only if it's going much slower. It didn't just match its speed naturally to everyone else, but now with FSD V12, it does. I've also never seen it shift in its lane for cars parked on the shoulder of a highway until V12. I don't think it was programmed to do that. It was only programmed to do that for semi trucks driving adjacent to you."
1cd3aqx,l1hx27h,"I've experienced instances like these while using FSD, and it is frustrating. The neural net should improve over time, especially now that it has so much more data to work with since the free trial. (Clever move, Tesla).

I think a lot of the decision making comes from a selected percentage of the fleet, particularly those who have Tesla insurance and fall within the highest scoring percentile. It's likely that the telemetry of only drivers who fall within say 97-100 are used. So, either it doesn't use data from drivers that behave dangerous and erratically (The real drivers as you mentioned) or it weighs them less heavily.

This probably also explains why autopilot behaves the way that it does. Being overly cautious in ***most*** instances going to cause issues for the drivers around you, but ***not always*** you specifically. Since the system really only judges how well your car is doing, it won't consider the fact that your vehicle slowing down before the off ramp is causing issues for the drivers behind you.

That is my working theory. I haven't yet taken the time to look into the specifics behind autopilot telemetry collection, but that is my best guess as to how it would be done."
1cd3aqx,l1f22lp,lol.
1cd3aqx,l1clac0,"Wait so V12 doesn‚Äôt go above the max speed the human sets if they do set a max speed?

A lot of people on this very sub were saying it did???

The no max speed setting is great for those willing to risk it"
1cd3aqx,l1cmhx2,"Correct. If you don't have auto speed turned on, it will never exceed the set speed. But it will go slower than the set speed if it wants to."
1cd3aqx,l1ctedb,"Good. Then it‚Äôs perfect.

I saw reports on reddit of it exceeding the max set speed. And several people saying the same thing. That would actually be idiotic. 

Apparently ‚Äúthis week‚Äù hasn‚Äôt occurred for Elon yet even though it‚Äôs april and not march so no FSD for me so I can‚Äôt test it for myself."

17a6caj,k5azimi,"The camera occlusion error when driving at night is common in low light areas.

The cameras likely being identified as ""occluded"" are the pillar cameras, and this occurs because there are some roads where there's no light coming from the left/right of the car. This means that the cameras only see black, which the car interprets as the cameras being covered.  Once the pillar cameras see light, the issue goes away.

My 2022 Model Y doesn't exhibit this issue because the headlights bleed light out the sides, which provides *just* enough light to satisfy the pillar cameras, however, my 2019 Model 3 will exhibit that issue because it does not have that light bleed.

The not getting out of the passing lane is a tricky one.  On a two lane road, no, it will remain in the left lane to its heart content, this is largely a safety measure to avoid vehicles that might be stopped on the shoulder.  This is not a perfect solution, but it does remediate the issue of people not paying attention with Autopilot and hitting things on the shoulder.

On a three lane road the vehicle should exit the passing lane and return the to center lane a little more regularly.

If a car is tailgating you pretty badly, the car will eventually get out of the passing lane.  It's a game of distances and timings, and often people behind you are simply impatient and will change lanes before the car takes initiative."
17a6caj,k5bhjug,"Don't forget, if FSDbeta is set to ""Assertive"" mode it doesn't move out of the passing lane automatically. Leave it in ""Average"" or ""Chill"" and it'll move out of the way of people coming up behind you."
124nrx8,je00gz5,"This morning FSD 11.3.3 made it across four lanes of busy Chicago commute traffic to get from the inbound express lane on the Kennedy to exit at Washington. About 0.5 miles for the maneuver, zero touch. Never managed this before. It was super smooth, too, at picking the openings, being slightly aggressive and telegraphing its intent to get other cars to make way. Really cool."
124nrx8,je0eiay,"You know you can hit the blinkers to request a lane change yourself. The car might wait till the last minute, but you know the traffic pattern better than it does. Use the blinkers and get over into the lane you need to be in to make the turn. Don't just wait for the car to know what it needs to know, its map data is old an not good enough.  You can also take over and report a blurb about ""wrong lane"" or whatever."

It went to the right-most toll booth (first time I let it auto-nagivate through a toll plaza), but my navigation route was to go on the road the farthest to the left after the plaza. It wasn't going to make it past the 2nd to left road when either it or I disengaged (I'm not sure if I hit the brakes or it disengaged first. I'll call it a tie).

So it was far from perfect (I had a couple of other disengagements today), but I think this is the biggest step forward I have seen after 16 months of being disappointed with every hyped-up update: It was definitely much smoother stopping/starting from traffic lights and making turns, it slowed down very well for exit ramps. I'm actually excited to use it again after mostly giving up on it last summer."

It just has some issues negotiating the space needed for lane changes at the moment.

Progress is progress though."
124nrx8,je0g2kx,"I've noticed something similar but on multi-lane side roads. If it's in the far right lane, it'll make the turn without a problem. If it's in the left lane and knows it's going to turn right, it waits until the very last second and then panics trying to change lanes. It's not at every intersection, though. It seems to be at ones without traffic lights.

On the highway it's working great for me, at least here in Atlanta."
124nrx8,je00vrz,"What is your autopilot profile? Chill, normal or assertive?"
124nrx8,je0azuf,That‚Äôs great to hear. I have a test case here locally where the car needs to do something similar and as of today it has never happened. Hopefully when I get v11 at some point in the distant future I can give it a try. Lol. But really happy to read if your positive experience.
124nrx8,je0gcs4,"Ideally you don't want to have to do this. The car should be able to do it, and many times it has (I have the latest version). Once you report it a few times, I agree that it's time to do it manually.

It's struggling to do the same thing on side roads for me. If I use the turn signals to get it into the right lane, it'll make the right turn just fine. If I don't, it waits too long, panics, and then I have to take over anyway."
124nrx8,je0tiii,"I'm in the far right lane every time, the blinker gets engaged and it wants to exit but ends up waiting to long and misses it"
124nrx8,je389vz,How do you report things?
124nrx8,je0128a,Normal
1370pu4,jir7lhf,"No kids, no junk in your trunk  ===> model 3

Kids/ frequent junk in the trunk ===> model y

The interior components are near identical in the two cars"
1370pu4,jis4szl,Some people love cars over SUVs/crossovers. I prefer a car and love the Model 3. For practicality I would also drive a Y but given the choice and if lifestyle allows I'll take the 3.
1370pu4,jirdfz1,"When the Long Range Model 3 had 358 miles of range I would say unless you absolutely actually need the space there was no reason to pay more for a car that had less range and is slower, since they both have similar range now I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs really just what you like driving better."
1370pu4,jire7mt,"Cheaper purchase price, more nimble, lower Wh/mi, and more range. It‚Äôs only beneficial to get the Y if you‚Äôre like a family man who tends to drive people to and from places and go on road trips. If you‚Äôre just a suburban commuter that solo drives mostly, Model 3 is better and more manageable."
1370pu4,jiskhhb,"I drove both the Y and the 3 and I really enjoy how the 3 drives. I wasn't a huge fan of the Y, I hate the back window so much. 

It's only me in my household so having the smaller car works for me, but I do miss the space of my old mini-SUV."
1370pu4,jir967n,"I feel like the assertion in your post is wrong? LR Y < LR 3?  No? 

Huh? Am I missing something? Isn‚Äôt there a substantial difference in the other direction? Am I on crack?"
1bt6t21,kxlt7ow,I actually appreciate the quicker acceleration off the line. It used to be way too cautious and sometimes confuse folks letting them think it‚Äôs ok to turn in front of you while in busy urban areas. I guess I also tend to be quick if I‚Äôm at the line as well. Something you get used to quickly.
1bt6t21,kxkb0y1,Did you check to make sure the mode is set to Chill as opposed to Assertive?
1bt6t21,kxu97at,"I agree.  I also think that it is a little late in braking.  I also get a little nervous on ramps when it is wet.  It seems that Chill mode is about limiting the number of lane changes, not acceleration and braking.  I wish they would address this."
1bt6t21,kxkq9rk,Anybody else on a 2018ish m3 and still having the left blinker always on when using v12? Such a bummer as am so excited to test it but makes it not usable
1bt6t21,kz0ib37,I‚Äôm having the same issue. Accelerates right off the bat. Have you found any solutions?
1bt6t21,kxma52x,I would agree with that. I just wish it were a little smoother. The more rapid acceleration is not as efficient. I will get used to it. Just a small gripe. Overall loving V12!
1bt6t21,kxkjb35,"Yeah, I did and it's still zooming off from a stop sign haha. 

I drive like a grandpa and try not to use a lead foot. V12 definitely has a lead foot! 

Thanks for the reply"
1bt6t21,kxvb58q,Does anyone know if there is a way to communicate these concerns to the FSD team? Does the feedback function still work if we disconnect the AP and send a voice message?
1bt6t21,kz0yapk,"Nope... none of the settings fix this. I think it'll need tk be addressed with an update. 

We shall see what happens"
117rji1,j9dw9ro,"This has been my pet peeve with NoA for the longest time.  Bro we're exiting in a minute, why are you changing lane?!"
117rji1,j9djzv3,"It happens from time to time and can be a bit annoying, but calling it unusable is a bit much."
117rji1,j9g8twx,"This and other issues are annoying, but don't make FSD ""unusable"".  I use several work arounds but expect that normal updates will slowly correct these issues just like in the past.  In my opinion, FSD is currently too smart (in a simple minded way) for highway use.  Autopilot was more trouble free because it concentrated in the road lines and cars ahead of you and not much else."
117rji1,j9dy0cb,"It happens 5x on a commute. That's dangerous signaling, having to cancel the signal, and look like a crazy driver. A bit annoying is overly apologetic."
117rji1,j9f29kt,If it‚Äôs happening 5 times on a commute then there‚Äôs something wrong with your car. That is not normal behavior.
117rji1,j9gbpbs,What do you set your TACC speed setting to? It only happens if you set it like +x% above and traffic is going slower than that for some amount of time. Like I said.
117rji1,j9gtbo0,I sent mine to 10% over the speed limit
19en9h1,kjdsjzc,It‚Äôs call the FSD beta. As long as you have the latest software you‚Äôre good
19en9h1,kjdta0i,That button got removed some months ago when Tesla made it available to everyone who bought or subscribed to fsd. You have the beta and can use it. Just be careful and pay attention as it is still wonky in certain situations. It will also nag you very quickly if you aren't looking directly ahead so no messing around with the screen a bunch of using your phone.
19en9h1,kjerct9,"I'm anxiously waiting for V12. 

I test drove a V11 FSD and honestly, I was still impressed...albeit, a few times I definitely turned it off because I didn't trust it. I'm hoping V12 is IT ü§òü§ò"
19en9h1,kjdta0g,Ok beautiful. Thanks for not being mean!
19en9h1,kjdtfcg,"Ahhh ok that explains it.

Oh absolutely I'm a very careful driver so no worries. Appreciate the words of warning though!"
19en9h1,kjeriy0,Heck yeah! In 80% of situations it‚Äôs amazingly impressive. Hopefully V12 reaches 95%+
19en9h1,kjduhoe,"No problem! I have found the current version works pretty well in most of my driving cases which is a mixture of highway and suburban. Have yet to experience it going through a round about yet. Urban it gets a bit weird as it doesn't always deal with street parked cars very well. 


It can also be finicky with unprotected lefts or when it enters a left turn on a green to yellow light. We will see what improves when v12 comes out in likely another month."
19en9h1,kjerq6p,You see that video online? When it approached the firefighters was so impressive.
19en9h1,kjdvh4e,"Yeah I‚Äôve literally only used it for one drive back to work over lunch. It got completely screwed up in the beginning in a parking lot, then it felt like it was gonna go when checking for visibility to pull out onto a 6 lane road. After that, it did fantastic. Only wish it would‚Äôve entered work and actually parked, but hopefully auto park and summon come back eventually. 

Fingers crossed V12 is here sooner rather than later"
19en9h1,kjerviv,"Yesss that was crazy. Perfectly waited while the firefighter was walking, then moved on as they were out of the way."
1bv641k,kxxc68x,Can‚Äôt you create a second profile?
1bv641k,kxxjrqc,"I just noticed this too. I‚Äôve been using FSD for over a year and this is a recent change. In previous versions, a single tap downward on the stalk (remember stalks?) would enable TACC, and a double-tap activated FSD. I think this changed in the most recent update."
1bv641k,kxxnhh3,"I noticed the same, it's annoying, I want cruise control not FSD."
1bv641k,kxxpy5q,Don‚Äôt you just turn that top toggle to ‚ÄúTraffic Aware Cruise Control‚Äù?
1bv641k,kxxp9k3,"They could give it to me for free, I still will not use it‚Ä¶too many questionable situations occurred while trying the demo. Phantom braking at 50+ mph a couple different times. It dicks around at stop signs. Maybe I‚Äôm just an impatient control freak, but I‚Äôd rather drive it‚Ä¶"
1bv641k,kxxn3ff,"IMO they should allow FSD to be enabled with the double pull and regular cruise control with the single. That‚Äôs the way I had it set between cruise control and EAP. FSD is really EAP with some extras added. Considering they behave pretty similarly to each other on the highway, I don‚Äôt see why this would be an issue."
1bv641k,kxxlguq,Ironically this is probably the precise moment when Tesla also fixed phantom braking when using TACC.
1bv641k,kxxcrpd,Yes. Terrible decision.
1bv641k,kxxdk9d,"I read somewhere that is a bug and should get fixed in an update. But yeah, how did they even release it that way?"
1bv641k,kxy0pq3,So someone in another thread mentioned setting up 2 driver profiles. One with FSD and the other without. Then you can cycle between the two of them.
1bv641k,kxzu7gm,"It's probably pretty unique to my taste, but I wish I could set it to be single pull for AP, double pull for FSD.

Sometimes I just want to keep in a straight line! No lane changes to watch for (even with ""minimize lane changes""), setting whatever follow distance *I* want, or not wanting it to try to follow the navigation down a closed road!"
1bv641k,kxxpabb,[https://tenor.com/3MZy.gif](https://tenor.com/3MZy.gif)
1bv641k,kxxqqbn,What dont you like about it vs TACC?
1bv641k,kxy31of,"I love having FSD but one thing that would be nice is when you get a strike that the car would automatically immediately allow TACC at least. You can't even use something as simple as TACC if FSD isn't available due to whatever reason (looking at you ""cabin camera is unavailable"" error)."
1bv641k,kxycvpn,hit the 'I' next to Autopilot Activation. they just switched it to 1 pull for FSD and 2 for TACC
1bv641k,kxz2pyi,New to FSD but when the car is in park you can just select cruise control. Just touch the words and it is selected. Been going back and forth since I got the new update.
1bv641k,kxz44kp,"FSD, in my experience so far, works better than autopilot on the freeways. I do nudge it to move to different lanes (just tap the turn signal), though it‚Äôs been great."
1bv641k,ky01xcx,Yeah this is pretty stupid. There‚Äôs no reason they couldn‚Äôt keep FSD as double pull activation. Not that I was gonna pay for fsd anyway after the trial though
1bv641k,ky0457c,"I think it is a matter of raising traffic security, by eliminating any doubt what the car does itself. If you frequently toggles between TACC and FSD, there might be moments, where you expect it to be in FSD, but it is in TACC.

You can argue that the same implies non assisted driving vs. TACC or FSD, but the perceived difference is larger, and adds to better situation awareness."
1bv641k,ky17ydn,"Maybe the change is safety related? Multiple times in the past, I've tried to do a double pull for FSD but only accidentally do a single pull and engage TACC and have to suddenly take control of the steering when I wasn't expecting to. Who knows"
1bv641k,ky35cp5,Just set it to ‚Äòminimal lane changes‚Äô and it‚Äôs pretty much regular cruise control.
1bv641k,ky6sfn0,Had same problem with my M3LR 2024. What i did to combat the issue was simple; just activate double pull on autopilot activation. A single pull should then activate normal CC.
1bv641k,kxxnx61,Yeah I just want this stupid FSD trial to end already.
1bv641k,kxxwsi9,How did you get regular dumb cruise control?  My 2021 Model 3 (no FSD) never had it. TACC is the most basic level.
1bv641k,kxyax0p,"or you could set autopilot activation to ""double pull"". when set to double pull, single pull is TACC."
1bv641k,kxxcwl0,That is what I did.
1bv641k,ky2umss,Never thought of that! Very smart sir! And it's free. Just like multiple web pages.
1bv641k,ky1aolx,Can you change profiles while driving?
1bv641k,kxxpt89,"Yep. If you do not select FSD, there is an option to use single or double pull. But if you select FSD this option disappears and you are forced to have single pull FSD."
1bv641k,kxza57p,"A recent update added the option of forgetting about TACC and making FSD activate with single-pull.  Unless they removed the option a couple of updates later, it should still be configurable."

1bv641k,kxxf2k9,It‚Äôs not a bug. It‚Äôs intentional. They want folks to use FSD.
1bv641k,ky1i727,Completely agree!

1bv641k,kxxojsz,Same

1bv641k,ky1dpml,nah I'll just tough it out for a month.
1bv641k,kxzaavo,"No, ‚ÄúTraffic Aware‚Äù refers only to matching speed.  Cruise Control = TACC.  If you have lane-keeping too, that‚Äôs ‚ÄúAutopilot.‚Äù"

I‚Äôm on camera and obviously not sleeping. Idk. It‚Äôs cool to show people, that‚Äôs as far as I‚Äôve gotten with it."
1bv641k,ky0v0a9,Why would you force a strike on FSD to allow TACC when you could just disable FSD to get TACC? This also doesn't solve the issue of TACC being unavailable when FSD can't be engaged for whatever reason (like the cabin camera unavailable error a lot of us dealt with in previous versions)
1bv641k,kxxov27,Yeah at the top. I‚Äôll try

1buj0t5,kxtza1r,Never driven in NYC but I'm assuming I would
1buj0t5,kxtg66e,There is an option to enable natural drive in autopilot settings. Its not assertive that does this. I'm surprised it does ~20+mph above speed limit on freeways and expressways from what I've tested
1buj0t5,kxtzdfc,Freeway
1buj0t5,kxth7qn,"I'm using FSD, not autopilot.  I have everything tuned as aggressively as possible and have the set speed at 10 over but it still goes under the speed limit on anything but highways."
1buj0t5,kxtheyq,You need to turn on 'Automatic set speed offset' option under Autopilot settings tab
1buj0t5,kxtlqso,"Yeah the auto speed offset in the Autopilot menu is what you‚Äôre looking for. FSD still sits under the speed limit occasionally, but you can just push it up to the speed you want with the accelerator and FSD will maintain it pretty well.

In fact I find that I use the accelerator quite frequently, although usually just a tiny application, to encourage FSD to start a maneuver when it seems overly hesitant.

And then at other times it‚Äôll make like Evel Knievel and whirl out of a junction then sprint to 45mph in a 35 zone before slowing back to 38 or so. Super aggressive!"
1buj0t5,kxuh8n5,That also did nothing for me.  I'm also already on the 12.3.2.1 version.
1buj0t5,kxuhnop,"I really didn't see a difference.  If anything it was slower on auto on 12.3.2.1.  

With the manual offset I did see you can force it up a bit with the accelerator and it will hold but it rubber bands when it's really slow.  I can add about 4mph, but as soon as I go beyond that it resets to it's original speed as soon as I let off the accelerator.

Additionally, on actual limited access highway driving the manual speed offset works correctly, but auto is completely unpredictable."
9upkqe,e969ciw,"We should put things in context.  AP and Nav on AP especially isn't ""finished.""  I suspect this first release of Nav on AP is sort of a safety trial.  Tesla will surely improve the system, which I suspect will lead to more assertive driving.

Elon Musk mentioned there was a ""Los Angeles Traffic Mode"" they left out.  Maybe that was a joke, but at the least it's an acknowledgement that the system isn't up to snuff in heavy metro traffic."
9upkqe,e9613sm,Maybe this talk? https://youtu.be/_X5xotqyRAg
9upkqe,e97rb52,Yeah the AP can barely gauge distance to other vehicles with any decent stability (as evidenced by bouncing and dancing cars). I think it's gonna be a while.

9upkqe,e97ukgx,"The data used for the visualization is only a tiny subset of what AP ""sees"". In other words, just because the animated car icons are moving around doesn't mean that the sensors are giving invalid data or that AP is not interpreting it correctly. "

9upkqe,e98jtmj,I can‚Äôt believe you just said that. Lol
9upkqe,e97vn8o,"I don't see why the visuals would use anything different than what AP is interpreting around it. It would make no sense as you would have to run a completely seperate process/NN just to do the visuals. Why would you do that if AP has already calculated this "" more accurately""."
9upkqe,e98272i,"Can you provide a source for this?

I don‚Äôt understand why this keeps being repeated. It would imply the ‚Äúreal‚Äù data from the vision NN is getting ignored for visualization and... I guess _another_ entire image classification routine (which would also have to be NN per camera) is used _just_ to display the UI? That doesn‚Äôt make sense. I‚Äôve seen people say it‚Äôs an approximation. From what? We know the NN is outputting actually lists of objects and their relative locations; there is no approximation needed. It just doesn‚Äôt add up.

I understand that it doesn‚Äôt show the _entire_ set of objects the NN is seeing, but if it does show objects, and they‚Äôre bouncing around, that‚Äôs what the NN is likely seeing. We have no reason to believe otherwise. It‚Äôs literally more work so that something wrong can be shown.

Note: some people think that because the car isn‚Äôt driving erratically when the screen shows dancing or overlapping cars, it must be seeing them differently. This isn‚Äôt any sort of proof. The routines that actually do the driving are very likely ignoring any NN data that has low confidence ratings or isn‚Äôt needed in certain conditions. Just like they ignore stop signs, traffic lights, etc. even though NN can see those.

By the way, in conditions where such data isn‚Äôt getting filtered out, it *does* drive erratically. I certainly have experienced sudden jerking and cancellation of perfectly valid lane changes (like some kind of ‚Äúghost‚Äù car popped in). Another example is with path recognition. I have a stretch of road by my house that is under construction, so the lane lines are painted twice 1-2 feet apart. The Autopilot visualization pops those lanes in and out +- 1-2 ft. Steering wheel erratically pops slightly to the left and to the right trying to adjust and stay in middle. It‚Äôs a small enough error that is still works fine, but point is- the erratic lane popping I see on the screen really is what‚Äôs its seeing."
9upkqe,e983u55,"I completely agree with you. I think this comes from the myth some people here believe (that really needs to die- see transcript below) that the NN somehow also does the driving, and so the outputs are steering, gas, and brake- and so visualization data isn‚Äôt available and has to come from somewhere else. Of course, one of the obviously flaws from that belief is that as you pointed out, how _do_ those visualizations get generated then? Is Tesla running an entire other network just to show the UI?

But anyway, that‚Äôs obviously not the case. Testing such a network would be incredible impractical, the approach would be needless, and it would be much harder to ensure proper operation. The NN is just doing classification (outputting objects, location, and visible path) which is used by conventional software to take that information and actually drive the car.

Tesla Daily has a podcast where they interview Jimmy_d and I think it‚Äôs helpful in clearing up this myth. I transcribed this portion since I kept seeing this myth pop up so that hopefully it can put an end to it. The podcast name is ""Interview: Neural Networks & Autopilot V9 With Jimmy_d"". Emphasis below is mine.

> 43:30 Jimmy\_D: (‚Ä¶) and that‚Äôs training the network to _see_ essentially. So the network- I don‚Äôt remember, did I talk about? _The network in these cars- they‚Äôre not making driving decisions. So the neural network is not hitting the break, it‚Äôs not steering the steering wheel._ What the neural network is doing is, is it‚Äôs getting an image from a camera, and then it‚Äôs saying you know- that‚Äôs a pedestrian, this is drivable space, that‚Äôs a barrier, this is the lane marker, right? It marks that kind of stuff. 

> _And then you‚Äôve got this conventional piece of software downstream that gets this information_ (...) _and it understand it‚Äôs situation from that._

> 43:41 So the neural network basically says ‚Äúthere‚Äôs some pedestrian ahead of you, you know, 100 feet, 50 feet or what not, and the driving software says I‚Äôm in the middle of a left turn, if that pedestrian isn‚Äôt in my path, it doesn‚Äôt matter. And that driving code turns the wheel , hits the break, does whatever it needs to do.

> 44:44 _So that‚Äôs another sort of thing that I often see misunderstood in online forums, right? This idea that the NN itself is taking control of the wheel._ I think that misunderstanding comes from some sort of university studies that were done where people did end-to-end driving- where essentially the NN takes the camera in, and it turns the steering wheel in the back end- which is a cute trick if you can do it, right? It‚Äôs really easy to train‚Ä¶(45:11-45:55 explains why it‚Äôs easy to train but over simplistic)

>45:56 Host: So _the NN basically is responsible for understanding the environment and then there‚Äôs separate software that kind of takes that interpretation and then decides what actions need to be done because of that?_

>Jimmy\_D: Yeah. (‚Ä¶)

Anyway, I think some people got confused with the Karpathy talk where he is talking about all their classification code going from ‚Äú1.0‚Äù to ‚Äú2.0‚Äù and took that to mean that literally everything that has to do with self driving, including driving pedals, steering, etc is literally being done by a NN."
9upkqe,e98kbo2,"Your failing to acknowledge that simple errors/mistakes in the programming of the ‚Äúvisualization‚Äù could be the reason for dancing cars. We don‚Äôt know enough yet. 

I received an update after v9 to 42.3 and my dancing cars has significantly gone down. 

I say if future updates eliminate the dancing cars it shows it was more of an error with the visualization system. 

If there was errors with what AP was seeing it would be a much longer fix than a quick update a week later. 

Further proof for me the dancing cars is just a glitch.. when a car is actually close to me, my car beeps. 

But if a dancing car beside me at a light touches my car visually on the screen. No beeps. "
9upkqe,e98ta7b,"I didn‚Äôt fail to mention that, I just don‚Äôt see how that makes any difference.

As a software developer, fixing a visualization like this would be trivial- if it was only a visualization bug. They‚Äôve done a couple updates since V9 and this is the primary way of communicating the state to the user and they _still_ can‚Äôt fix a minor 3D bug? Doesn‚Äôt make sense 

If anything, to me- the fact they‚Äôve only managed to ‚Äúreduce it‚Äù after an update is the _smoking gun_ its the neural network. Because you can‚Äôt guarantee exact outputs on a NN. The more training and adjustments they do the better it gets. Hence why it doesn‚Äôt fix the problem, it gets slightly better.

But still, the _biggest_ problem with this hypothesis is that you‚Äôd still have to explain _how_ this visualization is even happening if it‚Äôs not the NN. 

> Further proof for me the dancing cars is just a glitch.. when a car is actually close to me, my car beeps.
 
As pointed out, this isn‚Äôt proof the UI has some glitch or that the NN is perfect.

At the end of the day, I can accept we are both speculating here. Just one seems to require way more of a stretch than the other IMO"

g7fzd7,foih1pt,"Most cars (see Teslafi Firmware) are on 2020.12.5 and, like my Model 3 with FSD do not have this feature.

g7fzd7,fohxkqf,"When making right turns like this, against non-stop traffic, how well does the Tesla react in terms of:

- How far can I see the incoming traffic? 
- Does it still go even though someone is standing next to the stop sign and has been standing there for quite some time?"

g7fzd7,foijiyt,"Got the update today and took it for a spin. Overall, I‚Äôm not in love with it yet. It automatically stops at every light regardless of if it‚Äôs green or red, unless you tap the accelerator. In addition, you can currently set the AP speed at 5 over the speed limit, but this feature is capped at the speed limit. It‚Äôs cool, but something I‚Äôll turn off for now."
g7fzd7,foixqhw,"Does anyone know when full-autonomy is supposed to happen (as in a person sits by the wheel but the car is able to drive on literally any road)? I might be wrong but I thought I heard Elon say like super soon, maybe this year? Was he wrong about that?"
g7fzd7,foja8ni,"Sooo.. Is it a 1/10 system or does it work in 999/1000? Did anyone found more than the five videos linked here?

g7fzd7,fojsnyl,stupid that FSD is not referenced in the release update since it only works with FSD. It should say that it works with TACC and Autosteer when you purchase the FSD package. Their documentation leaves out the FSD part of the message.

g7fzd7,foh5w7c,If you are in EA the future is several weeks ago. lol
g7fzd7,foi8pj9,Not quite yet. I tried it out today and it‚Äôs a bit unreliable for me. Comes to a stop too quickly instead of gradually. In my neighborhood there is a slight curve when it comes to a stop sign. There was a car parked maybe 200 feet away from the stop sign. Plenty of room for autopilot to navigate it and stay on my side of the road to come to a stop at the stop sign. Instead AP stopped behind the parked car. I mean it saw the stop sign fine because it gave the warning that it was going to come to a stop but it did not see the car ahead as parked on the side. It thought it was in the road.
g7fzd7,foi9rtr,Can you ask the future to hurry up and come over to the EU please? Thanks.

AI research project often are like that - impossible to know how long it will take until it is done. human-level play of GO board game seemed 5-10 years away, right up until alphago beat lee sedol on world stage. whereas full-self-driving has seemed 1-2 years away for like 5 years now."

Though apart from that one isolated tweet he's been asked the same question probably hundreds of times and I don't think he's made that mistake again of saying 100% it will happen at a certain time (has he)?

g7fzd7,foimse2,"> Autopilot miles are massively safer than human miles.

> In the 4th quarter, we registered one accident for every 3.07 million miles driven in which drivers had Autopilot engaged. For those driving without Autopilot but with our active safety features, we registered one accident for every 2.10 million miles driven

This is pointed out every time: Autopilot is primarily used on highways, whereas the non-Autopilot stats include both highways and local roads.  Even humans experience fewer crashes on highways.  The fact that the Autopilot stats are better than the non-Autopilot stats could be due to a larger percentage of highway usage, it may not be due to Autopilot being safer than humans.

> For those driving without Autopilot and without our active safety features, we registered one accident for every 1.64 million miles driven. By comparison, NHTSA‚Äôs most recent data shows that in the United States there is an automobile crash every 479,000 miles.

Those two numbers ought to be the same.  Isn't it odd that they aren't the same?  There's no way that Tesla drivers are four times better than the average, it's likely Tesla is collecting stats differently from the NHTSA."
g7fzd7,fojau0k,"what kept you in lane and at a distance there is basically ACC and lane assist, you can have that in just about any car in that price range.

g7fzd7,fojty7e,And realistically the first iteration will be too slow for cars behind you and all of the false positives or stopping at greens etc. Still will likely be a gimmick for a long while until city NoA comes out. Hope I am wrong though
g7fzd7,foifpbf,"Ah, I see. That's pretty sweet."
g7fzd7,foifmwy,"Oh, neat. Thanks!"
g7fzd7,fohsck1,Last example is pretty bad form with driver using something strapped to the wheel to prevent nagging.
g7fzd7,foi2zni,That fourth example is likely normal behavior to account for any false positive detections of red lights
g7fzd7,fohd772,Thats ^coool.
g7fzd7,fokpm2j,"I mean I don‚Äôt have it yet, and I both have FSD and always seem to be top in the queue for updates."
g7fzd7,fohz7cp,"Yeah honestly I'm worried there will be some highly publicized accident, which is mostly the fault of user misuse, that causes anxious regulators to force Tesla to Nerf FSD. I'd rather they take their time."
g7fzd7,foi67zv,This is must viewing for any Tesla owner especially those who own FSD.  Just the many variations of Stop Signs that exist and what they have to account for was surprising.
g7fzd7,fojutdw,"That is helpful and definitely the best transparency we have on autopilot. Still which we had more info but we do have pieces of the puzzle to assemble a rough outline of the problems faced.. 

My understanding is that they had a lot of trouble getting to a comfortable foundation/underlying framework which basically needed real world feedback to realize hardware 2.0 and 2.5 were just not cutting it. The ""wrapper"" to bring it all together requires precision and proper timing too based on compatibility with everyone who paid for FSD. These were major pivot points that took years of trial and error to arrive at a baseline stack that is swappable and predictably scalable. Plus the whole Project Vacation development of auto labeling which means less time working on real new features to show the progress (which imo is massive and will scale quickly as Elon has been saying)

The next phase of autopilot will likely be finding out safe ways to implement new features that add convenience until big features like NoA city work damn near flawlessly.

Auto labelling will allow the team to fix issues quickly and roll it into new updates on the fly. Imagine how crappy lane detection was when the first version of AP2 came out. It took many months to get better. This should cut down that time by a huge order of magnitude (to use an Elon phrase lol)

So basically get a little excited, we are almost at the point where Tesla may have an internal build pairing the ""feature complete"" with an early, wonky NN that will be step 1 into the next phases of FSD. Of course new hurtles may be found in this new process but hopefully now they have a more streamlined approach."

Local roads have intersections.  Intersections are dangerous places.  Autopilot cannot be activated within intersections.  It therefore has a lower percentage of local road usage and also experiences none of the crashes that happen within intersections.

The manual also states that Autopilot should only be used on divided highways.  If you used it anywhere else, you were using it wrong.

See table 32 on page 55: https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/811402

All you have to do if the light is green is tap the pedal and it won't stop.  The indicator is the red line turning grey.  So at every stop sign and traffic light the line will be red and it will stop until you tap the pedal.  As far as I can tell, the car will show you that it knows what color the traffic lights are, but it doesn't do anything different based on it.

I'm not sure I follow your logic. If I turn on autopilot at the start of a 100 mile road with one intersection, which autopilot would drive through even a year ago, and only drove on autopilot for 10 miles of highway, how can you say ""therefore has a lower percentage of local road usage""? I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just asking for any source data that proves this, which an educated guess doesn't.

The word ""divided"" doesn't exist in the owner's manual I downloaded today: 
https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/model_3_owners_manual_north_america_en.pdf

Technically, it says not to use on city streets. I won't argue with you that I am not using it in accordance with the manual. My question was whether there is data to prove more autopilot miles or time (however you prefer to define ""use"") on highways vs city streets. If none exists, the answer just would be ""no"". I'm not arguing with you about ethics of it, just asking if there's data to prove what people keep claiming as if they are facts. 

In Table 32 I see breakdowns by 1-4 lanes, and not-divided, divided, one-way, and unknown. Which of these is highway and which is city?"
g7fzd7,fonouv5,">given that prior to this update, Autopilot was (and is still, to some extent) non-functional on surface streets. What would you do, turn on Autopilot for a block and then turn it off when you want to stop at an intersection or make a turn?

>The manual  
>  
> also specifies that Autopilot is to be used on highways only (""Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is primarily intended for driving on dry, straight roads, such as highways and freeways. It should not be used on city streets."").

I'm not sure what you mean by ""non-functional on surface streets""; I've been using it for a year and a half on city streets just fine. 

I start my commute with TACC on through our 15MPH residential zone, then 4 road segments to get to the highway, which I use TACC and/or Autosteer for the 3/4 long segments, 3 miles total. Highway for 7 miles before traffic then turns into city street, which I can follow for 5.5 miles with 2 turns to my parking spot. 

Usually there's cars in front of me so it stops for those. Yeah, I have to take over for turns, but can lower TACC to a safe speed for those turns if traffic allows, or bring TACC all the way down to 0 MPH.

Have you used TACC or Autosteer? I try to use it whenever possible; frees my mind and eyes up to look for more diverse hazards. Coming from a motorcycle, this is what you're taught to do all the time anyways. Now, instead of the 2-5-12 second scan loop I can divert more attention to the 5 and 12 seconds away problems.

I do know the manual says not to use on city streets, but that doesn't mean people actually follow that.

I think we've established that it's an educated guess that autopilot is used more on highways, but we don't have the data to say for sure.

&#x200B;

Regarding highway vs city, I was aware of the NHTSA stats. Those are deaths per 100M VMT, not crashes; is there any data that specifies crash numbers instead of deaths that you know of?"
g7fzd7,foia8et,It's super cautious because the system isn't 100% reliable. They make it stop at every light because they know that it won't stop at every red light. Make it stop at every red light is the difficult part of the problem.

g7fzd7,fok9fq9,"I'm saying exactly the opposite; I agree with /u/kenriko that a ""last resort"" version of it will make it to base AP because of the additional safety it provides. But people get in accidents doing literally *every part of driving*. Any piece that you can reliably take away from a human and give to a computer is a safety improvement. I'd wager that you could call nearly every feature of a complete and reliable FSD package a ""critical safety feature"".

Autopilot was initially billed as a convenience package, but eventually became good enough in certain situations to be considered a critical safety feature. It also raised the initial price tag of the vehicle and maybe pushed some people out of the market. I can see the argument for the same thing happening to FSD in the future, but not anytime soon. Jacking the price of the car up by $7k and making FSD standard would make every Tesla a safer vehicle, but there would be a whole lot fewer Teslas on the road.

It should also be noted how fortunate we all are to be having conversations about which features should be free or paid additions to our *existing cars*.

Anyway there will be repercussions for a company if they program a computer to break the law. We get away with speeding because the city doesn't have enough resources to ticket everyone and most people don't speed excessively. But if a company is caught programming cars to intentionally bypass the speed limit then that is just as bad as getting caught speeding with a radar.

Speed limits may be raised as cars become autonomous but traffic in general will flow much better if it was mostly autonomous cars. Left lane will no longer be blocked, better lane flow as slower cars stay on the right, and less accidents to block the road."

Not to mention that if it ever changes lanes to the right most lane, you then have to watch it goof up on-ramp lanes where it swings wildly as it hunts the outside lane rather than sensibly keeping to the inside lane. If they can improve these cases, I‚Äôd have much more confidence enabling NoAP with auto lane change. "
b9rsie,ek77cfh,"My problem is that even on Mad Max, it constantly wants to get *out* of the ""passing"" lane, only to slam on the brakes to get behind a guy going 10mph slower with no one in front of either of us. That's just plain stupid."
b9rsie,ek7k3rh,"Average worked perfectly for me. Every time I wanted to change lanes, it did. Not too much, not too little :)"
b9rsie,ek7gq4t,I have mine set on mild and it was trying to change lanes every 20seconds. It was also constantly changing its mind on weather or not it wanted to. 
b9rsie,ek7i129,"That's  absolutely right. Mad Max is not the same as being assertive. What it does is basically seek to change lanes if car ahead is slower than my set speed limit. It's kind of dumb, really, because it does not address HOW it behaves when changing lanes. It is almost always passively yielding and other drivers around it would probably wish it can assert better so as not to screw up the traffic rhythm (I'd much rather let someone change lanes in front of me assertively than a slow ass indecisive wavering driver.)

What it needs is an assertiveness setting, which decides whether to yield or overtake in lane change or merging conditions. Low assertiveness means it's weighted to yielding always, high assertiveness would be to assert the space in a more aggressive yet safe fashion."
b9rsie,ek7lz9a,MadMax works for me. :)
b9rsie,eka0e60,I actually intentionally set NOA to mad max for the first time to get a little more comfortable with it and see how reliable it really is.
b9rsie,ek6gvp7,"Shouldn't this go without saying? I mean mad max was designed for the impatient driver, set it to mild and go..."
b9rsie,ek6fl78,Preach.
b9rsie,ek6gnxb,Yeah its how I feel about Ludicrous. If I had a car with ludicrous there's no way it wouldn't be enabled. 
b9rsie,ek6rwpv,That‚Äôs like enabling ‚Äúchill‚Äù. I personally don‚Äôt know why that is an option. 
b9rsie,ek7rgg8,Agree.  :)
b9rsie,ek6gpzx,"I'm looking for a more aggressive merge between cars in the adjacent lane, which is really what should be labeled Mad Max."
b9rsie,ek6hv5n,It's gotta vary car to car. Madmax is straight annoying to me. Normal is perfect! It passes slow people and stays out of the passing lane. 
b9rsie,ek76ljk,Navigate on autopilot... when you have a route planned and are using autopilot it is an additional mode that will suggest/automatically change lanes and take exits and interchanges until you are off the highway. 
b9rsie,ek76o8d,Navigate on Autopilot. Car will navigate highway interchanges and overtake slower cars by itself (with you hands on the wheel) 
b9rsie,ek6h44i,"According to the other posts, that's exactly what this update does. Make it more confident , and work better overall because the Neural Net was updated. Elon said ""it's not just a setting change"". Do you have the new update? has that been your experience with it? "
b9rsie,ek6guo3,A lot of that is quite improved. Not perfect but much better. 
b9rsie,ek80ylv,[deleted]
b9rsie,ek6jwyx,"I think a lot of people, myself included, initially thought that Mad Max would make it change lanes in a more aggressive ""crowded LA freeway"" manner, not suggest lane changes right before your exit."
b9rsie,ek6h6dy,Wastes your battery and takes long time to heat up. Wouldn‚Äôt pay $15k extra for that. 
b9rsie,ek78skw,My friend gets super car sick in my car. We figured out that if I put it in chill mode it helps loads. I hate it but its better than the alternative. 
b9rsie,ek70fax,"If you have to let other, more ICE familiar drivers use it I suspect.

My mother already drives like a demon and that's in a *prius,* if I ever need to lend her some wheels no way it's going to 60 in 5."
b9rsie,ek7riyl,"If my wife ever drives, she would likely switch to this just in case."
b9rsie,ek6t7zz,When you have sleeping babies in the car
b9rsie,ek7rtvs,"I'd rather stay in the passing lane, unless someone is approaching me from the rear.   The people on my main route demand either going 77-80mph in the left, or 50 one lane over and having to stop periodically for merging traffic.  "
b9rsie,ek6h6ad,I just got 2019.8.5 last night. Haven‚Äôt tried it yet. 2019.8.3 exhibited the issues I mentioned. Will have to give 8.5 a try 
b9rsie,ek6h0ei,I‚Äôm am however confident that eventually it will improve considerably 
b9rsie,ek89zyb,"Interesting - this came up today for me. I just upgraded to 2019.8.5 and tried the updated NoA. Car wanted to move from center to right lane just before a merge lane onto freeway was coming up. As it began to make the lane change, a car on the merge lane was about to leave merge lane and enter right lane of freeway. The car in the past would always suddenly slow down to give way to the merging car. Not today. It hesitated (slowed down) for a split second, then sped up and completed the merge. I was surprised and happy!"
b9rsie,ek6lx73,"You sir don't understand the difference between ludicrous and max battery/ ludicrous+

Ludicrous all day, doesn't waste any more battery below 80% throttle input. "
b9rsie,ek8ayr1,You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about 
b9rsie,ek8mati,Wouldn‚Äôt you accomplish the same thing by just pressing the go pedal slower on the default setting? 
b9rsie,ek6w99i,Don‚Äôt slam the go pedal.
b9rsie,ek7s2sc,I'm not sure you'll be able to take advantage of NoA in its current form then. May want to stick to normal AP
b9rsie,ek6hyfp,I used 8.5 this morning and it is insanely good. 25 miles on the highway to work I didn't do anything but keep my hands on the wheel. I was laughing out loud it was so good. I can't wait to drive it home! 
b9rsie,ek8mvmx,I wasn't flooring it. And most of the time we were on the freeway on autopilot or I was driving. He could just feel the torque regardless. 
b9rsie,ek6wwqk,Please chill üòÇ
b9rsie,ek7tcie,"Oh I know, I like the experimentation though, and will see how it goes."
b9rsie,ek6w6sj,"reports still say that it still doesnt do well with auto lane changes in medium to heavy traffic. So for most of us, it likely wont help in our daily commutes. I'll have to try later in Bay Area traffic"
b9rsie,ek6mi98,I too was laughing out loud. Best car ever
b9rsie,ek6lg7e,Awesome. 
b9rsie,ek6rxvh,Awesome. Excited to give it a spin!
b9rsie,ek8iga4,How was the drive back? 
b9rsie,ek6wr1c,"For me this morning, it did very well even with medium traffic. The worst it did was when I was getting to my exit, I personally would have gotten over early. But the car decided to stay in the middle lane, and then when it wanted to get over, it slowed down to get behind a car it had recently passed. It did all of this flawlessly, but it was just a very non-human behavior. Beyond that I'm really not exaggerating - the highway driving was perfect. I'm taking a lot of footage and will compile a short video tonight. I'm looking for any mistakes. Only negative so far is the 1 stop light I came up to on AP was not detected. "
b9rsie,ek8otf7,"Pretty great. It was definitely capable of things it wasn't before. I had to intervene twice, unlock on the way to work with 0 interventions. The initiated lane changes are 10x better "
b9rsie,ek6xf3e,"Ill have to give it a try. My 10 mi commute takes 30-40 minutes due to bay area traffic so it can handle that, it should be pretty good. My other issue with previous versions is that it wanted to get over too early before an exit and if I did make the lane change, I would have to wait another 5-10 minutes."
b9rsie,ek79wjf,"Sounds like human behavior to me. But what I want from my car is for it to behave like a good driver, not an average driver...."
b9rsie,ek96vki,I drove maybe 15 miles on NOA so far (new version) and have a similar feedback
b9rsie,ek6xsle,"Hmm well today is my only data point, but it got over to take the exit later than I would have. But that of course could just be a difference in driving styles. "
b9rsie,ek7hlbi,"Haha true. But if it's too good, people around it will get frustrated and confused "

vvescr,ifjc2o3,How would it react to a plane landing on the highway?
vvescr,ifjiiht,Can not see it clearly but one of the reason I don‚Äôt use autopilot is the car only try to drive in center of lane no matter other cars is close to your lane or there is potholes. Looks like FSD can swing to other lane avoids crash I like it
vvescr,ifjipu5,Real nice except for the next part where it goes straight though a right turn only lane.
vvescr,ifk2btg,"With every update, I trust it more and more."
vvescr,iflrtzp,"Does anyone know if you can get beta through just subscribing to FSD, or do you need to buy it outright?"
vvescr,ifolaof,"I'm more and more convinced Tesla is using HD Maps in San Francisco.

It's drawing solid red lines on roads it can't see yet. Meanwhile my car has a hard time drawing red even when it's visible and not completely unobstructed.

We already have proof from Mars' Lombart street video of it using HD Maps but just driving around it's seeing things that it can't see and doesn't see in my region at all."
vvescr,ifjprho,"Meanwhile Tesla hit harsh brake, when a biker cross the street behind my car and already passed him"
vvescr,ifloy52,Every update is like driving with an alcoholic that drank one less shot of tequila that day. Or just drank a margarita instead and still told their sponsor they are making progress.
vvescr,ifk471j,I'm clearly out of the loop.  I thought a hand on the wheel was required at all times?
vvescr,ifji9i8,"It also reacts quickly to a car that‚Äôs sitting there and it thinks is moving into your lane. üòë Talj about whip lash, and scaring the crap out of you."
vvescr,ifmjrb1,That‚Äôs awesome!  You know what‚Äôs more awesome? $12000!
vvescr,iflazgw,"Ah yes, i see it now... on the right inbetween the 7th and 8th pixel."
vvescr,ifke128," >Video starts. Pedestrian is clearly beside their car. Tesla FSD reacts 3 seconds later.


Good job I guess?"
vvescr,ifkfheh,[deleted]
vvescr,ifld22r,Meanwhile the traffic aware cruise control can't make it around a curve in the road without slamming on its brakes for no reason.
vvescr,ifkdiky,Keep your hands on the wheel. This is how people will be killed.
vvescr,ifpstrm,"I like this video. That's excellet. My question is when it will also be a ""good"" driver and take care of difficult information like parking spaces with intention-based routing."
vvescr,ifjh1im,Assert dominance with other autopilot systems.
vvescr,ifjqmuj,There is a ticket in the backlog for that
vvescr,ifjdxdm,"They simulate for that sort of stuff.  Plane isn‚Äôt specified but see the left of the 3 examples at the time below. 

https://youtu.be/j0z4FweCy4M

1:36:28"
vvescr,ifjdzet,At this point? Probably not react at all when it's overhead and then treat it as a regular car or truck when it lands.
vvescr,ifkwf9r,"If surrounded by lava and a cliff, does it drive itself over if the lava gets too close?"
vvescr,ifjjkzq,Yeah FSD beta is way less rigid about where it drives. It will happily move to the side or even partially into a different lane to avoid things.
vvescr,ifk48vd,I agree. Should bias to shoulder like most people would if oncoming cars are too close to center line
vvescr,ifkglfj,[Location where it occured](https://goo.gl/maps/ugQAk6npaaZya72k7). If you follow the street view to the intersection you can see that the HOV and turn lane is only during 5am to 8pm Mon-Fri.
vvescr,ifjplay,"It looks like one of the hov or turn right lane since there is a diamond before the right turn painted in the lane, there is one near me like this and basically you can drive straight if you are hov or you can only enter the lane when you are about to turn right"
vvescr,ifjkboe,Mine loves to plow through bike lanes and especially likes swerving into the oh-shit lane to ‚Äúpass‚Äù the car ahead of me that‚Äôs stopped for traffic
vvescr,ifmdpti,And it blew through a red light at 1:36.
vvescr,ifmqfgo,I've said this before and I'll say it again; this sort of complacency is the most dangerous part of the beta. FSD is very inconsistent in that it might see a black dog in the street at night and react to it and then not see an immobile concrete barrier or column and drive right into it.
vvescr,ifk573v,"So what are you up to, about 1 mile? Only 5 more orders of magnitude to go!"
vvescr,ifmdy53,"You can get it through the subscription, same as if you had bought it outright"
vvescr,ifpgavk,"That isn't necessarily HD mapping, though a lack of HD mapping doesn't preclude priors.

The car's NN is trained by millions of videos paired with their ground-truth labels. In essence, that NN lossily encodes the learnings of those millions of videos... if you go into one of their known scenarios, your car is then potentially lossily decoding the ground truth.

It... doesn't really work like this, but it's not too far off."
vvescr,ifjv767,Sure it was because of that biker?
vvescr,ifkffdu,"No. You're supposed to have your hands on the wheel all the time, but it'll let you go like 15 seconds or so without any hands before it warns you to put your hands back on."
vvescr,iflnxf7,Twitter video quality üòç
vvescr,ifkfipc,"No, the pedestrian was in their car and then opened the door and stepped out."
vvescr,iflh8p4,"Those are time-based HOV lanes in S.F.  If you watch other videos of WholeMarsCatalog as he drives around the City you'll see a lot of it.

Perfectly legal."
vvescr,iflijic,"The car in front of them also went straight. But regardless, the current FSD build isn't great at picking to correct lanes. This definitely needs work.

Not sure how any of this is propaganda though when the car did what it did. No one is editing and faking this."
vvescr,iflnsvx,Because that code hasn't been significantly touched in years. All the advanced development is happening on the FSD beta stack.
vvescr,iflhx07,"Once the FSD neural networks are in a more complete state, every feature in the car will be using a portion of them even if you haven't purchased FSD.

I notice a big difference when switching between the public AP build and the FSD beta on the same roads."
vvescr,ifl8912,[removed]
vvescr,ifjevru,"You can link specific times to videos on youtube.

See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0z4FweCy4M&t=5788s"
vvescr,ifkgf28,Experienced this a couple times today on Mopac. It was uncomfortable but it worked fine.
vvescr,ifljb2w,"I suspect the problem is that it's not smart enough to detect (or anticipate) a damaged or obstructed shoulder.

Lots of chipped concrete, potholes / gutters, mile markers, overhanging branches, debris, loose gravel etc. that you get to encounter if you use the shoulder where other cars don't.

And they're also often hard to spot in time, it's more that humans judge a shoulder as looking kind of dodgy and avoid it before a major problem appears."
vvescr,ifl2qhe,"on two lane roads I am more likely to hear the double yellow reflectors being run over than ever having my car cross the white line for the shoulder.   
  
I would say the bias is already there and its not on center but left of it.  
  
The ultimate system would of course be one that adapts to your lane positioning preference as long as its deemed safe."
vvescr,ifler30,"Yes, but the car can‚Äôt read the small hours in the sign. It didn‚Äôt even render the turn only sign on the road‚Ä¶it accidentally did the right thing."
vvescr,ifjvtlp,The HOVness is probably also on weekdays during certain hours
vvescr,ifmedvm,Thank you! Do you know if you get it back if you let your subscription lapse but then restart it again later?
vvescr,ifqmkch,"I thought about that but Lombard for instance is perfectly rendered without any noise. I don't think it's just over fit. It just magically appears.

If they do badly overtrained/over fit Lombard street that it is rendered before creating the top of the hill I would expect all sorts of Lombard streets to appear incorrectly all over the place. Or too soon, or slightly too late.

Looks to me like they've just got at least parts of San Francisco in memory."
vvescr,ig5956s,There is HD map. They don‚Äôt rely on it. Greentheonly has shown the map in his hacked Tesla before. There is no such thing as decoding ground truth in inferencing. The inference is just weights in a model. Ground truth would be a HD Map.
vvescr,ifjxo7f,[Yes I'm sure ](https://photos.app.goo.gl/VH7DHxXSGPLZPmNw8)
vvescr,ifkjecs,Thanks!
vvescr,ifkhydi,[0:01](https://imgur.com/a/cuaVJDg) Man in khakis and black shirt can be seen outside of the car. Also the car had it's hazard lights on. All I'm saying is FSD had an eternity in compute time to swerve.
vvescr,ifltdgb,Yeah but in the meantime using just cruise control is ridiculously dangerous.
vvescr,ifpggdd,"A few days ago, I recalibrated my car's cameras. Autopilot came back first, and FSD couldn't be enabled til I parked & unparked my car. I simply felt so unconfident using Autopilot over FSD. Autopilot's pretty darn good, but FSD is leaps and bounds ahead on city streets."
vvescr,ifjf51j,"I‚Äôm aware but I am on mobile, how do you do it through the app on mobile?"
vvescr,iflnjn5,"It could probably read the hours but it's not trained to do that yet. There are many types of signs it simply ignores for now. But yeah, probably an accidental following of the rules in this case, although highway AP does already handle HOV lanes."
vvescr,ifm9d1c,Map data likely has that information. But the car does actually read road signs with text (not always correctly)
vvescr,ifmtxa0,"That I‚Äôm not sure about! I‚Äôm guessing you can get the beta again but you may have to go through the safety score verification process again, I haven‚Äôt tested it out though"
vvescr,ifnjpho,"Yes, but you have to start all over with earning a driving score, just like before."
vvescr,ifmqnjt,Hilarious but also scary
vvescr,ifkivif,"He came out of the car right then. It's not like he was just standing next to the car the whole time.

It's just cool to see it react to things like people opening their doors and getting out of cars. Nobody is saying it's some crazy swerve. Just neat. That's it. It's not like it's a normal thing that cars do this lol. This is very novel stuff for a consumer vehicle."
vvescr,iflv5hl,"It's really not though. It's not useful in all situations, but it's certainly not dangerous. We'd see an alarming rate of accidents with autopilot if it was ""ridiculously dangerous"". But the accident rate is good."
vvescr,ifji1tq,"Add &t=XhYmZs to the end of the link where X is the number of hours, Y is the number of minutes, and Z is the number of seconds. So the link to 1:36:28 in that video would be: https://youtu.be/j0z4FweCy4M&t=1h36m28s"
vvescr,ifli5cu,"Instead of typing a bunch of numbers: 

Go to chapters in the description, hit view all, then hit the arrow next to the chapter you want. 

Or you can hit clip and select the first 60 seconds. If the person you share with wants to keep watching they just hit watch full video."
vvescr,iflohnv,With enough data points it could have figured it out the schedule without even reading the sign.
vvescr,ifmlkbk,Proof?
vvescr,ifkrnej,Point taken. It's a minimum viable product to me but there is no reason for me to be sour over a difference of opinion.  :)
vvescr,ig5c9gq,"Yes. Similar to, for example, masturbating at work. It's not dangerous because the numbers on getting caught don't bear it out. But get caught that one time..."
vvescr,ifjnyy2,Nice!  Thanks!!  Easy :)
vvescr,ifls4wg,"Maybe? Not sure exactly how theg could do that. But either way it's simpler to just read the sign. They're certainly not doing something that specific and advanced right now though, if that's what you mean."
vvescr,ifpfyo8,"FWIW your question boils down to ""would a GPS tell me to do the right thing"". That tends to be the case for situations like this, and isn't what I'd consider a key obstacle to FSD being viable.

If route planning tells the car to go forward on the rightmost lane, it'll do it. If it tells the car to take a right or stay on the forward leftmost lane, it'll do it."
vvescr,ifku72c,"And to be clear, I'm not saying it's abundantly useful yet, but it's certainly cool and impressive. Just weird to dismiss it as ordinary when it's very much not."
vvescr,ifjo11u,No problem
vvescr,ifkc7jj,[Super easy](https://c.tenor.com/dP_0YeNlPMQAAAAC/supereasy-barely-an-inconvenience.gif)

y1ar17,irwd94d,"I‚Äôm also in Denver and had a very similar experience going down Lincoln towards Capital Hill. It would jump lanes previously and be nearly unusable, but two drives from 25 to 17th on Lincoln were flawless, even with lanes closed near the Capital.

First time in nearly a year of beta where I could see the car doing all the right things."
y1ar17,irwg1c5,"A sketchy exit ramp off a sketchier highway to drop our kids off at school was 100% failure 3 versions ago. It started to improve but was still 50/50. 

The last 2 days it‚Äôs been 100% on 8 trips, so, yeah, something is happening and moving things in the right directions. Though I‚Äôm also spoiled now with many zero disengagement drives and fewer ‚Äústep on the go pedal so the car behind me doesn‚Äôt get annoyed‚Äù interventions."
y1ar17,irx1dq7,"It seems improved a bit here and there, but it also comes to a dead stop at the one roundabout near me and won‚Äôt even attempt it. Older versions handled it reasonably well if very slowly.  
  
Making a left turn through any kind of intersection is still as bad as ever. It cuts dramatically through oncoming traffic lanes. Totally unusable unless the road is empty."
y1ar17,irwm84t,"The wheel is much smoother and the car is noticeably more confident. Biggest jump in progress I‚Äôve seen in a while. Still work to be done, but great improvement from last nights test."
y1ar17,irwfcco,[deleted]
y1ar17,irwani6,"I had same issue on Colorado blvd. Not tested it yet. 

I did notice yesterday it stopped stopping in the middle of small street intersections because of our dumb double stop signs. That‚Äôs a win."
y1ar17,irwm9yp,"A bit smoother, but same trouble spots for me. It goes crazy when turning at one specific intersection. Does not change lanes on specific street to make right at next intersection."
y1ar17,irwq3dg,"I can never find quite the right place to ask this so here goes. 

I regularly drive on a 4-lane divided highway.  There is almost no reason for me to ever NOT be in the ‚Äúslow‚Äù lane yet my car constantly thinks I‚Äôd be much happier in the fast lane. Despite the speed limit and no one being in front of me. 

Enthusiastic turn signal application will briefly keep me in my line at the cost of appearing to anyone behind me like an inebriated teenager on a learner‚Äôs permit, but then my car will decide again that it REALLY wants to be in that fast lane. 

Does anyone else have this behavior?  It makes it pretty unusable for me at the moment on 2022.20.17 but downloading 2022.20.18"
y1ar17,irwc67n,I'm going to have to make an excuse to go back to Colorado Blvd. and try it again.
y1ar17,irwd9nr,"Hope it goes well for you guys. I still need to do some more testing. There were other spots further away where you‚Äôd have a left turn coming up and it would take one of the earlier left turn entrances before the correct one or it would blow by it altogether. I‚Äôll comment after I have a chance, but so far the close to house stuff is looking good!"
y1ar17,irx2wia,"Yesterday I almost got into a pretty big accident from FSD Beta. Was in the left turn lane with 2 lanes, trying to stay on the right to turn immediately onto the freeway.

FSD immediately and suddenly tried to get into the left lane (which would have made me miss the freeway entrance), almost entering the lane right before another car would have likely smashed into me (the turn lanes are long, so people go quite quickly if one of the lanes are more empty up until the light).

Thankfully I kept my hands firmly on the wheel since I'm used to the car trying to put me in the wrong lane, but it was the first time I felt that the car did something extremely dangerous that I 95% of the time would not have been able to react to.

The car making poor decisions in terms of which lane to stay in is increasingly showing to be more and more dangerous than annoying.

While I believe in Tesla and FSD overall, people should definitely be aware of this kind of thing. Since it tends to happen more when the car is stopped and another lane is open, most likely the cars in the other lane are going 30-60 mph and are probably nowhere nearby until the car makes the decision, at which point you'll likely be rear ended essentially going 0 being hit by a car going 40+. This is the worst place for a car to be acting like an irresponsible 16 year old, and has the potential to definitely put you in a very bad accident."
y1ar17,irwnw6j,"I noticed it being much better, but it also tried to turn left into oncoming traffic rather than yield"
y1ar17,irxqvhm,"I really wish I could share your enthusiasm but my post with my median problem is on 10.69.2.3 which had no real improvement over 10.69.2.2
  
So, maybe FSD is meant for cities where everything is straight with nice right angles and not for those of us who have roads with curves, medians, and more.
  
Somewhat sarcastic but I want to make the point, it is not even close to anything that will be usable in the near future. Nowhere near close.  
  
I am still crossing gores and even solid white lines dividing a turning lane from the travel lane and I don't want to be in that turning lane. I am still unable to reach my parents home with ten odd miles without more disengagements than I can count let alone that damn phantom braking for the medians on a divided road.  
  
and don't even get me started on the absolute and I mean ABSOLUTE shit maps they have which don't have any speed limits for nearly all roads I have recently been on when all the major map companies I checked have clear data, when a fucking seventy dollar GARMIN knows the speed limit.  
  
which is made more hilarious because FSD will not register a speed limit sign that occurs too soon after a turn on a new road. Completely ignores it - never visualizes it."
y1ar17,irz5my2,"Does the cabin camera notice when wives are in the car and force the car to do dumb shit?

After I installed it last night, I took the family to dinner and it required a few disengagements and one time started to creep into a red light after properly recognizing it and stopping. It waited like 10-15 seconds before it rolled forward."
y1ar17,irx17n1,"Completely agree, I‚Äôve been in Beta since the first round was released (initial 2,000 or so after the YouTube crowd got it). This was the first time I can visibly see FSD as a real thing in the next few years. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, each improvement was a strong step forward, and I was glad to be a part of that testing journey along the way. But this version just clicked, I had several zero intervention drives where I genuinely felt comfortable with FSD driving. I had versions that did well, but it would still jerk the wheel or next version, something would regress. I feel like this is the first time it all came together and the car was driving much more smoothly."
y1ar17,iry1xfb,"FSD is still terrible in the school zone nearest my house. Three lanes in front of the crosswalk for kids, the left two lanes turn into the school the right lane is the through lan going straight. FSD always picks the middle lane (a left turn lane) and try‚Äôs to force running through the intersection. Totally not safe in the school zone. 

The other trouble spot, also near my house, is a right turn into a short two lane section of road. After turning right, the right hand lane is a right turn only, the left lane is the through lane. FSD always gets in the right hand only turn lane. It doesn‚Äôt try to merge into the left lane (the through lane) until the middle of the intersection. This is where the right end ends and you are supposed to turn right. 

I am in both of these intersections(scenarios) daily always break off FSD with the brake AND flag it with the video icon. They can‚Äôt fix it."
y1ar17,irym4t2,"Today was my first day of 10.69.2.3 and I did about 110 miles of driving around the city using FSD as much as i could bear. It really seemed like a mixed bag. It didn't seem to improve anything that it wasn't already doing. it did try to run two red lights that it stopped for and then just for no reason decided it was done waiting and it would go for it. it did it three times in a row at one red light, like it would try a full send when the light was red. i'd slam the brakes on, take my foot off the brakes reengage FSD and yeet! straight for it again while the light was still red. three times there, one other time at a different intersection. Something weird is going in with this release, it's never tried that even once on me before."
y1ar17,is14220,"Congrats. Mine is just getting worse and worse with every build.

I tested it this morning at 6am with no traffic around me.

https://i.imgur.com/XtlZBjy.jpg

Two lane road with a right turn coming up. A third lane is added on the right as an extra turning lane when coming up to the light.

Left lane is left turning lane. Two right lanes are right turning lanes.

I was on the right lane of the two lane road. As we were coming up to the light, my car switched to the left lane quickly, then as soon as it finished merging into the left lane it instantly switched not to the right lane but to the extra lane that was just added, cutting across an entire lane.

It's embarassing. I was attempting to show it off to my friends on the way to the gym."
y1ar17,is0z0ut,"I drove it all the way to work in self driving mode this morning. There were still a couple of troublespots. But the one thing I can say that is really improved is the lane selection logic. We are definitely a long ways away from ‚Äúdriverless taxis‚Äù but after multiple updates that seems the same to me, this one was definitely an improvement. 

I do have some of the issues that posters to this thread f mentioned. Speed limits are annoying. In some places it doesn‚Äôt read the signs at all and in others it will suddenly slow down when it sees a sign. Yet others will see the sign and max speed will change, but it coasts instead of slowing down. 

I noticed this morning on an unprotected left turn on a turn lane here in Colorado with the blinking yellow arrow, it creeped to the middle of the intersection (like I would have) and then slammed on its brakes thinking it didn‚Äôt have time to turn in the gap, but it actually could have. This caused driving behind me also wanting to go to honk. 

I almost think we need the ‚Äústudent driver‚Äù magnets on the car while in FSD mode :-)"
y1ar17,is61rf5,"It‚Äôs still HORRIBLE on highway 7 in Brighton. It will take turn lanes when it should be going straight, then freak out and try to get back over. Lines are painted well. That I don‚Äôt get."
y1ar17,irwq7mw,Feelsgoodman
y1ar17,irx7xk7,"I am also very impressed with this versions functionality around Denver and Colorado Springs.  It used to stay in the left lane, then cut across 2 lanes of traffic to take a right.  Now it properly predicts where to go."
y1ar17,irx8fww,Yep.
y1ar17,irxxhpk,"What are people‚Äôs experience with speed bumps? 

Took my first beta drive today, had to slam on the brakes for both speed bumps encountered."
y1ar17,irxyyvm,Agreed 2.3 is very good. Next up no right turn on red awareness.
y1ar17,iryn5mo,"What is a raven model s, and does it affect FSD? ‚Ä¶because mine is still dumb sometimes."
y1ar17,irz19qj,Complete opposite for me. Seems super hesitant near stop signs. Maneuvering around parked cars is still risky ash. Cuts super super close to them. Have to disengage most of the times
y1ar17,irz4a0z,"It is gradually improving, but I noticed that it gets badly when it turns to non-standard width streets. For some reason sometimes it is trying to veer you onto upcoming traffic"
y1ar17,irz9yeq,I lost all my settings with this update. I even had to reprogram HomeLink/garage door opener.
y1ar17,irzd2hp,My car wont take the exit off the highway going home... Still 1 yr later... :( booo lol. I keep reporting it but still wont exit... I havent really noticed any other improvements or downgrades from last version though.
y1ar17,irzkjwy,"It‚Äôs noticeably better for me when taking turns and not being as jittery, however, I did have one complete mess up when it go in the left turn lane at an intersection about 2 blocks earlier than it was supposed to, so I had to disengage."
y1ar17,is0rpkz,"I have over 550 AP miles, 98 score, how long does one wait to get beta?"
y1ar17,is27b74,"yea, on 69.2.3, i am still waiting to be able to drive on any roads near by. Double yellow middle line and one lane going each direction is great, unless you are going under 35mph. Every, single, car it will break. Some times to a full stop. Glad to contribute to the machine."
y1ar17,is5zuh7,"Man,  .3 was a step down for me from .2.  

But, my whole experience boils down to how it can handle two left turns on my way to and from work.  Both are double lefts going into multiple lanes.  

.2 handled it the best by far of any version.   Chose a lane confidently, stayed in the lane on one‚Ä¶ still had disengagements on the other bc it kept trying to dive into the wrong lane mid turn.  

.3 seems lost.  Won‚Äôt pick a lane approaching.  Hesitated throughout the turns, even following a car.   Yesterday looked like it just gave up mid turn and tried to go straight.  Crazy."
y1ar17,is7w8lt,This update ruined my week old car.
y1ar17,irwdezn,Right on! I‚Äôll have to test it down there as well.
y1ar17,irzws7k,"Maybe they are coding west to east because here on the east coast turns still suck. Every right turn is still: creep, creep , creep, wait for it, FLOOR IT! Left turns are: Floor it, those oncoming cars have brakes."
y1ar17,irx2l5n,"That‚Äôs interesting, I‚Äôve had pretty good luck with left. Turns around here, but things are painted pretty well. Unprotected left turns at stoplights seem a little better as well, but I have less experience with those personally."
y1ar17,irx6bv1,">That‚Äôs interesting, I‚Äôve had pretty good luck with left. Turns around here, but things are painted pretty well. Unprotected left turns at stoplights seem a little better as well, but I have less experience with those personally.

It needs work on roundabouts for sure."
y1ar17,irxuejb,"Cutting into the on coming lane on  left turns has been a peeve of mine for years -for human drivers.

I wonder if FSD learned from humans cuz a lot of people do it.

I always assumed the humans were too damn lazy to turn their wheel so they just cut into the opposing lane."
y1ar17,irxuaeo,[deleted]
y1ar17,irys20o,">It feels to me like 2.3 was a bit more than just a simple bugfix update.

Yes, [Elon has confirmed this](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1577716440299442187) to be the case."
y1ar17,irx0ag5,Make sure you hit that video camera to send those issues to Tesla.  I noticed one problem intersection I had and it was fixed in the updated release.  Maybe coincidence maybe it's because I hit the button who knows
y1ar17,irwt2r0,Are you on assertive mode? Car will prefer the fast lane on assertive.
y1ar17,irwsmsu,"While this is autopilot, not FSD, my car always moves to the left lane during a freeway switch, only to immediately go back to the original lane to exit from the new freeway. Very annoying.  It also keeps trying to go in the HOV lane even though the navigation has it off."
y1ar17,irxajvx,"The car has been inconsistent about which lane it would change into, and it often tried to change lanes immediately upon activation. I have it on Chill setting. For example, I changed into slow lane, activated FSD, which changed to the fast lane and I changed it back to the slow lane. It's embarrassing."
y1ar17,irzxr2r,"Yes, this is the thing I hate the most. It happens most to me on a road that does have quite a few entrances and some crossroads. My guess is that FSD decided it would have less to worry about in the left lane. I‚Äôve reported it with the camera icon dozens of times. This started in the early summer, and they totally ruined 40 miles of a drive I do frequently where AP/FSD actually was a pleasure to use. I see the new visualization too, so I believe this is FSD behavior, not NoA. This is a road that NoA would switch to two blue lines instead of the single line back in the pre-beta days."
y1ar17,irzznd8,"Lol, you are braver than I am if you engage FSD with your wife in the car!"
y1ar17,is15pdx,That sucks! It‚Äôs odd that it varies so much. Makes me think they are literally mapping and learning using the fleet and areas of the country that have less beta testers are the worse. But in San Jose it works like a charm everywhere lol.
y1ar17,irxxpkm,Those have never worked for me. Always have to disengage for them. I wish they would at least put a ‚Äúmark‚Äù button or something since they don‚Äôt seem to learn those or care.
y1ar17,irzzd4v,"It seems like lane keeping is the highest priority because FSD ignores speed bumps, potholes, roadkill, trash, tree limbs , etc. The Take Control Immediately gods often scream at me as I swerve around this stuff"
y1ar17,is0itdd,Highway still uses the old Autopilot stack so that likely won't be fixed until the two are merged.
y1ar17,irzzyvh,"Denver is like a giant grid.

east coast is the opposite. at least in New England."
y1ar17,iryaa6n,"Isn't Boston just a bunch of paved over horse roads?

Probably going to be a while until that's solved."
y1ar17,irxwnkl,Is it with the same version or a prior version?
y1ar17,iry5gr5,I haven‚Äôt tried the latest FSD beta version yet but so far I can‚Äôt even go 3 miles with turns in low traffic suburbs without disengaging. I‚Äôm amazed with the progress so far but I can‚Äôt see this being reliable and safe enough within the next 5 years that I would feel comfortable with my parents using it.
y1ar17,is16ktk,"Been using FSD for a year in Boston. It is SO much better. I was previously taking over pretty much on everything that wasn't just going straight. Now I intervene 2-3 times on my 20 min commute.

I'm pretty sure Tesla does A/B testing on individual builds around various variables. When I first get a build it sucks around pedestrians / bikes. After a couple weeks it reverts back to being reasonable."
y1ar17,irzfnoi,He was referring to 69.3 not 69.2.3 which is being discussed. I don‚Äôt think anyone is publicly testing 69.3.
y1ar17,irx3pj2,That's always a good idea. I use that button every drive but the problem has persisted since May.
y1ar17,irwtql4,"I'll check when I get home. 

That would be a good and simple fix. 

Thank you so much!!"
y1ar17,irxla7u,"Assertive mode only applies to FSD beta, which is only active on city streets. They're talking about divided highways."
y1ar17,irzy35p,I used to be on assertive mode but dropped to normal to see if it would be any safer about jumping into oncoming traffic when turning left. I still get the ‚Äúchanging out of rightmost lane‚Äù message every mile or so on one road I drive. FWIW I have the option selected to change out of the passing lane.
y1ar17,is1gwl7,"Yeah, I don't know either. I'm in Dallas/Fort Worth. Every time I drive around during the day it's common to see a good number of Teslas. The other day there was 4 of us side by side at a stop light. 

My brother has one, my roommate has one, I have one, my other friend has one. 

There's plenty of us in DFW, especially the Plano area where I'm at."
y1ar17,iry3a4u,"Any way for us to report issues we find? I had a lot of turn signal and turning lane issues. 

For example, no turn signal used when moving into a turning lane, but then the signal comes on once in the lane. 

Also, prematurely merging into a turning lane that has multiple turns. Like, it‚Äôs one long lane with multiple turns, but you‚Äôre not supposed to turn into the lane early and cruise past the first turn (white lines block off the lane in between turns, if that makes sense)"
y1ar17,is0l7jp,"It switches to FSD on this exit. Its like a cloverleaf type exit. It will get off the highway on the stretch and switch to FSD, but it wont make that exit off that stretch. it will barely attempt to get me off that stretch, otherwise it would send me back on the highway if I dont manually take over."
y1ar17,irychoo,[deleted]
y1ar17,irxg2jn,That's unfortunate. Guess it hasn't made it through their updated training yet...
y1ar17,irx03r4,There is also an option for speed adjustment Lane changing or something like that. I'm not in my car so I don't remember the exact language
y1ar17,irxlnus,"Assuming it's recognized as a divided highway and therefore FSD beta is disabled on it, you have to go to navigate on autopilot settings and either turn off speed based lane changes or set it to mild. Assertive/average/chill only applies to roads where FSD beta is active."
y1ar17,is1h7mx,Yeah I‚Äôm in DFW a fair amount. Plenty of teslas and the roads are well marked in most cases (Carrollton seems shitty lol). I agree should be better there.
y1ar17,irzzfvr,I‚Äôve noticed that turn signals seem to come on later than earlier versions. The only way I know to report is to click the camera icon but there‚Äôs no way to provide explanation or context.
y1ar17,is0dnse,That is super helpful.  I'm traveling right now but I can't wait to try your suggestions.  Thank you so much!!
y1ar17,is028nu,"In your welcome email, they explained that they want you to send an email with the date, time, and VIN with an explanation of the mistake it made each time you press the report button."
y1ar17,is11eod,No problem
y1ar17,is04n6f,"Thank you. I missed that in the email, but found the instructions. As far as location, do you know how precise that needs to be? I often have problems in a road without mile markers."
y1ar17,is0cje4,I never got an email
y1ar17,is0gbwq,"When I press the button, I'll tell Alexa to ""take a note"" so I can describe what happened before I forget. Then, when I start writing the email, I pull up the note in the Alexa app, review it (if necessary), and delete it since it is being handled. Then I copy a small template from the prior email into the new one and adjust the date, time, and Beta version (if necessary). I run TeslaMate for data logging, so I sometimes go back through my drives to identify the millisecond when the issue occurred. There's no way they can miss it with that level of detail. I usually mention the town as I have no idea how they are looking for the data from the button press. Then I explain in plain English what Beta needs to do differently.

""The navigation prompted me to turn right onto Pine St, but the car never signaled for the turn and completely missed the entrance to the right turn only lane.""

This happens to be a real report. One exit out of my development was completely jacked up in OSM. I fixed it in OSM nine months after I got the car. It took them 15 months to incorporate the fix and include that exit in route planning. Now the car will use that exit when leaving and tell me to turn right into the development when returning, but it does not execute the turn. It never signals and just blows right by the entrance to the right turn only lane.

Another one of my repeating reports is, ""please don't put on the turn signal just because there's a curve in the road."" I send that once per Beta update. There is also one particularly nasty intersection that the car can't get right no matter what. I tend to try that one out after each update and send a new report if warranted."
y1ar17,is0guwx,>!fsdbeta@tesla.com!<
y1ar17,is1t8go,"I‚Äôm running Teslamate too, so I‚Äôll look there for the trip data in the future. Thanks for the tips: Using the voice memo is a great idea."

aimclp,eep3kdb,Who's cares if it's a knock off? The core mission of Tesla is to advance sustainable energy and transport... this is great. Remember Tesla open up a bunch of thier patents on purpose
aimclp,eeoqnq9,"China has zero shame, its almost funny"
aimclp,eepccrq,Why are people bothered that it's a knockoff? More EVs on the road = Tesla's mission.
aimclp,eepga8h,"Tesla knockoff? Did you look at anything besides the headlights?

The general proportions, size, and profile are similar to the Nissan Murano and basically every other crossover in that segment. It looks nothing like the Model X besides being white and having pointy headlights. As for the interior, it's minimalistic with a giant screen in the middle, which is going to be commonplace in electric cars. 

It's true that China's trademark and patent infringements are bullshit but this is not an example of that. They're only guilty of building a generic-looking electric car."
aimclp,eeou8cr,"Honestly, for a Chinese car this wouldn't be considered a knock-off. The knockoffs there look basically identical, like this [Range Rover Sport clone](http://www.thedrive.com/news/23353/chinese-automaker-clones-the-range-rover-sport-with-the-25k-zotye-t900).

The seats and gauge cluster are...very heavily inspired by the Model S/X but other than that the car isn't really directly lifting anything far as I can tell. Maybe the huge glass roof is also too similar, but I think they actually really restrained themselves from directly copying.

It's too bad they didn't copy a frunk though, makes it rather less useful."
aimclp,eeoqigr,"TLDW; interior front looks a lot like the Model X. Everything else was grossly inferior. 5 passenger, ~150mi estimated EPA range, and with a LEAF style battery design safety is probably terrible. ""Knock-Off"" is a little too generous. I would go with cheap imitator."
aimclp,eep0eck,"Door handles are probably more reliable

edit: as someone who is currently ignoring my ""replace 12v"" warning even though I have a new one sitting in the trunk, just because of what a nightmare it is to access - 12v looks far more accessible."
aimclp,eepeq3g,"How is this a Tesla knockoff? As long as the Electric vehicles are taking over the petrol/diesel vehicles, we shouldn't worry about copying.... Or should we?"
aimclp,eeovmqm,"TBH, I thought it looked more like a Honda CR-V with a different front stuck on it."
aimclp,eepg5d2,It doesnt really look like a knockoff when you consider how difficult it will be to make truly distinctive looking vehicles once the manufacturers really begin omitting all the grilles and faux grilles. Aerodynamics is a harsh mistress too.
aimclp,eepkpol,i don't get it tons of cars look like that. doesn't seem like a knockoff. 
aimclp,eepkyot,Knock off of what? It doesn‚Äôt really look like an X to me. It actually does not look terrible 
aimclp,eeosboi,"Not the most blatant copy I've ever seen, at least."
aimclp,eep01jx,[deleted]
aimclp,eep996f,"Hey, if it‚Äôs electric. I‚Äôm cool with it. 

Lotta Chinese hate but they are miles closer to an all electric country than the US. Also making a  R isn‚Äôt easy so I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre pumping EVs out. "
aimclp,eepbg8u,This must be the Model Why?
aimclp,eep7jxc,We forget that the Chinese were able to hack into the us military archives and steal the blue prints for many jet fighters.. it‚Äôs much easier with cars.
aimclp,eep8f2a,"That... looks exactly like a cheap Chinese iPhone clone from 15 years ago. Fascinating, but also scare, because people will die when that thing malfunctions."
aimclp,eepdei8,I laughed out loud when they opened the front hood.
aimclp,eepupbr,"Looked like it had a charging port on both sides, about the only thing I liked. The outside was far uglier than an X, inside was an exact copy."
aimclp,eeoqzwg,Literally the shadiest cheap copy I've ever seen. It's wild that the Chinese are comfortable with that. 
aimclp,eepedxz,Can you imagine how safe all that electricity would be in that car? Scary thoughts...!
aimclp,eepf0v1,"Sort of there, it is a pity that the frunk isn't empty. Love the windshield"
aimclp,eephrm6,I'm wondering if that 'bump' on the roof is LIDAR for some sort of autonomous driving capabilities. 
aimclp,eeplq3j,"As quoted above, Tesla‚Äôs agreement not to sue a party for patent infringement extends only ‚Äúfor so long as such party is acting in good faith.‚Äù The Pledge goes on to state that a party is acting in good faith as long as they have not:

asserted, helped others assert or had a financial stake in any assertion of (i) any patent or other intellectual property right against Tesla or (ii) any patent right against a third party for its use of technologies relating to electric vehicles or related equipment;
challenged, helped others challenge, or had a financial stake in any challenge to any Tesla patent; *or

aimclp,eepom7l,Explodes and burns passengers to death -china
aimclp,eeprgpd,"I hate the whole ""_______ killer"" trope. This looks like your average run-of-the-mill SUV. Why even bring up Tesla? This sort of vehicle will only appeal to people wanting a full electric vehicle in SUV form. People who want a Tesla, will pay for and buy, a Tesla.

Copying an original idea doesn't suddenly invalidate the original idea.

This goes doubly for brand-conscious buyers. Tesla is premium brand.

Remember all the iPhone killers? That was a laugh."
aimclp,eeps81n,This just reinforces that China continues to IP steal everything in sight.
aimclp,eeptkct,Looks more like a Bolt than a model 3. Bolt killer?

aimclp,eep8q37,it's not really a knockoff if they can't get the drive train right. teslas don't look that good. it's the tech that matters on teslas.

aimclp,eeowjpd,"I wouldn't knock on the Chinese. It is actually very hard to make a modern car from the ground-up. Just look how many countries outside of the first world, Japan and South Korea have been able to engineer cars by themselves. The Chinese have just been making for the last two decades...it's not a long time. And during this short time they have atleast made the EV market their own. This Xpeng might look like a knock-off, but it is made by them and while be sold them in their own country, all goes into the economy.

Either-ways, whatever works in that market. For countries like China and even more so for countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, Phillipines, Thailand, India, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina etc you really have to build super cheap and super simple electric cars if you want to sell them in any numbers. 35k is luxury!"
aimclp,eer1og0,"The Chinese people like quality and they generally stay away from Chinese made products themselves unless they can‚Äôt afford the imports.  

Recently I bought 2 scooters for my sons and one of them was advertised as an exact clone that was made in the same factory as the M365 Xiaomi.  The price difference was only $100.  So when I got them both they looked pretty similar.  But the quality was night and day.  Even though it works, everything about it was just janky.  Speed controller finicky and loses connection on bumps.  The neck has over 1‚Äù of play back and forth, this thing is not going to last at all.  The bolt threads were tearing out wtf.  Both made in China but the quality was horrible.  The body was plastic instead of metal, the size was smaller also.  So their marketing was a lie.  

I would rather pay the difference and get another bird scooter.  This is why I will not try again in the future.  Always stick to reputable companies."

aimclp,eeridi3,"So it has headlights like every other car that has come out the last decade. Personally I'd roll this car over an X, the X isn't a looker. It looks more like a Nissan than a Tesla. The side profile looks very Nissan Rogue."
aimclp,eeshosl,"I'll accept the term ""knock off"" but a copy it isn't. I could see it having some similarities to the Y, and that would be ironic. In China it could take a few of model 3 sales, but nothing significant in the rest of the world. For me, the *only* advantage over the 3 is the hatchback. I'm hoping the Y isn't too off road-ish, at the expense of on road behavior, as I don't see them bringing out a 3 or 5 door model 3."

aimclp,eeoqeci,[deleted]
aimclp,eep4iw1,"You're right. Even if the range is ""only"" 150 miles, that would satisfy many people's needs since the average drive is less than 50 miles per day. And $35K/$24K before/after subsidies is attractive.  

Tesla has to get it's act together on the $35K Model 3 ASAP or else risks losing a large part of this market to foreign brands. It may be several years before Tesla can produce that vehicle profitably."
aimclp,eeow0hx,Not bad at all.
aimclp,eeqlxb9,"Go watch Chinese crash test videos and tell me their cars are ""legit"""
aimclp,eeowllv,"Lol alibaba.. yet another knockoff of a US based company üòÇ

There cloud compute service is literally AWS. I literally studied for AWS certifications and was able to obtain equivalent ones for Alibaba Cloud with no extra knowledge. That shows you how much they even tried to change it up.  "
aimclp,eeplflf,"Anyone who has a financial stake in Tesla cares. Keep promoting theft though! 

Also please stop lying about Tesla opening up it's patents. Show me a source where Tesla has stated that companies can steal it's patents and technology for profit."
aimclp,eeoyezd,"On the contrary the founder He Xiaopeng asked Elon Musk personally if he can use the patents and got a yes 

Edit: English"
aimclp,eepq90e,"I don't understand how this car is considered a knockoff. It is very similar in a few areas, specifically the instrument cluster look and the large center touch screen and very different in many other ways. The body of it doesn't look anything like the S X or 3. I don't see myself ever mistaking this car for a Tesla."
aimclp,eep8tyu,lol shame about what? going from one of the poorest to the second largest economy in the world in only a few decades? how do you think a country as far behind in the race as china was going to catch up? they'd have to innovate pass 3 generations to reach the front if they didn't copy.
aimclp,eepl1qo,"I'm not bothered. In fact, I don't really think it looks much like any Tesla except the interior dashboard dual-screens. And maybe the front end looks like a Model X a bit. But generally speaking, if I just randomly saw that car parked somewhere I wouldn't be mistaking it for a Tesla."
aimclp,eep09ix,Isn‚Äôt ‚Äúcheap imitator ‚Äú pretty much the definition of knock off?
aimclp,eeoxvyq,What is with the semantics here? It's a knockoff. 
aimclp,eephpip,"I mean, it's also \~$21,500USD after government subsidy. You could get a genuine Performance Model 3 and this for less than a Model X."
aimclp,eeort19,"It doesn't look half bad.  Is it reliable, fast, safe?  I would guess something has been compromised on."
aimclp,eepq4d1,"At least Tesla learned from their mistakes, they made it dead simple on the Model 3."
aimclp,eetntqf,And the media player too....
aimclp,eeqcslj,"I agree, but throw in a little Range Rover Evoque too"
aimclp,eep0j8l,That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called s knock off - it will knock you off in an accident 
aimclp,eepzedq,There's no reason Tesla can't do a port on both sides is there?
aimclp,eep25nu,"What's Tesla going to do, sue them?  "
aimclp,eeotkwa,yeah i mean... the people who design and build these cars are highly qualified engineers. Surely they want to work on something high quality that they are proud of?
aimclp,eeqg891,Or a Model y preempt-er ?
aimclp,eep2bzt,That's pretty much what people said about Xiaomi and Huawei before they kicked the shit out of Apple in Asia.  
aimclp,eep742o,"> I just don‚Äôt see Chinese electrics going well

Meanwhile, Chinese smartphone makers continue trouncing Apple in Asia and are starting to push into western markets."
aimclp,eeoy4iw,When has China ever made something from the ground up. They simply rebuild knock offs 
aimclp,eepn2qv,"Well I will knock on the Chinese. Theft is never acceptable. Something being ""very hard"" is not an excuse for crime."
aimclp,eeoqhkq,musk seems to welcome the competition! sooner ev revolution :D 
aimclp,eeoqtnf,"Yeah when the knockoffs burst into flames they are forced to buy a new car. Planed obsolescence. The perfect plan. Infinite market.
/s"
aimclp,eeos411,China has already been making cheap cars.
aimclp,eep0nv0,"Or maybe there is room in the market for luxury EVs,midrange EVs, and economy EVs?"
aimclp,eer5hdx,"Erhm, the Nissan Leaf already does 150 miles EPA on 40 kWh at lower price and it's hardly the most desirable thing out there. The point of selling cheaper EVs is not to compromise range, charging speed and performance to the point they are no longer desirable, it's about maintaining what makes it a good car while dropping the price. At $35000 and 47 kWh it's pretty much outdated already. I assume charge speed was not mentioned because it's equally old gen."

aimclp,eepp64r,Feeling anger in this response..not sure why
aimclp,eeptof6,"It looks literally nothing like a Tesla. 

Oh my god it has a large vertical touchscreen in the middle and an instrument cluster that is the same shape. "
aimclp,eep0e9c,"I‚Äôm thinking this is probably good for the EV industry. They are not going to steal many Tesla customers, but they will get all of the EV customers that can‚Äôt afford a Tesla. "
aimclp,eepf238,Do you have a source? Just curious
aimclp,eep1j3c,All Tesla patents are publicly available. 
aimclp,eep8j6b,Citation? 
aimclp,eep6ljg,"> On the contrary the founder He Xiaopeng asked Elon Musk personally if he can use the patterns and got a yes

Interesting, so this is one of the companies that ""partners"" with their open-source policy"
aimclp,eepl3jq,"Even if this is true, they didn't even design their own car. That interior is just a straight ripoff of Tesla. That's a step beyond just using battery tech Tesla may have open-sourced."
aimclp,eeprdci,This is the correct way to change the world.
aimclp,eeram8f,"Yes,  but only as long as they do not copy their design. On the contrary, getting permission to create knock-offs is off of the table, and they might be very well sued for that. Won't happen in China, though. The culture of copying and stealing desings is too entrenched."
aimclp,eephngl,Aren't teslas patents open source ? Also I think the car looks nice  
aimclp,eepm32r,Show me a source. Looks like theft of intellectual property to me. Not that that is unusual for the Chinese. Stealing technology from smart white people is their way of life.
aimclp,eere060,Tesla made their patents free so why not use it? For a startup company it could be very useful
aimclp,ees6ybd,"Why would he do that? Tesla already released their patents for anyone who in good faith, wants to produce electric vehicles? "
aimclp,eeptivm,They copied the design because it‚Äôs great. Start with a great design and innovate from there that‚Äôs how things improve 
aimclp,eepkr4z,"Ummm...intellect, innovation, hard-work? You are seriously proposing that it's alright to steal technology from others because they are ""far behind in the race""? GTFO of here chinese shill. China is a bunch of lazy bums. Their current success is based on theft of intellectual property and the exploitation of a migrant labor force. Disgusting. Soon they will be back to the third world where they belong. Theft and spying should never be rewarded.

"
aimclp,eeoy4nk,"Yeah, pretty sure ""cheap imitator"" is the definition of knock off."
aimclp,eepknlm,"How? The front of the interior, I totally see. The rest I can't see at all. Let alone the exterior. "
aimclp,eep59gy,[deleted]
aimclp,eepa25w,"Made in china enough said, china makes nothing buy junk that falls apart in a week "
aimclp,eet3maa,"Just looked it up and I wouldn't say dead simple in comparison to most cars that the instructions to remove it are ""open hood. remove one bolt."", but its a hell of a lot easier than ""remove 100 clips. remove frunk liner. remove a bunch of bolts. remove plastic trim. remove more plastic trim. unplug HV system. remove some more bolts. Almost there!""

The 12v warning has been on for like 2 or 3 weeks, I have to replace the front sensors as well, and last night the right headlight went out right when I got home. I can't procrastinate much longer or I'll be working on this thing for days."
aimclp,eepzkrv,"Cost? I wish I had it on my vehicle. A lot of my city charging isn‚Äôt long enough to reach around and is staggered to the passenger side back while my port is driver side front, and being on one way roads where you cant face the opposite direction, it gets super annoying. "
aimclp,eep5m0j,I was referring to Chinese consumers. 
aimclp,eeotu69,Probably wasn't their choice to build a cheap clone. Blame it on a corporate figurehead. 
aimclp,eeqh1v5,"You‚Äôre right, but I‚Äôm talking about a car that very reliably drives itself on the highway.. not a phone"
aimclp,eep628j,"> they kicked the shit out of Apple in Asia.

They kicked the shit of *everyone except Apple*. The trend of iPhone sales shrinking is simply the trend that lower-end phones are getting better, be it Xiaomi, Huawei, Samsung, or Motorola. If Xiaomi/Huawei didnt exist, then Samsung and Motorola would eat the cake no problem. 

In the high-end segment though, Apple is still king. Its just the high-end segment itself is shrinking since people are comfortable with low or mid-end phones these days."
aimclp,eepmvsx,"Exploiting migrant labor and employing spies to build stolen technology = ""kicked the shit out of Apple in Asia""? 

No. It's easy to win the game when you don't play by the rules (China seems to not have rules except censoring it's citizens). China's capitalists are criminals and would be arrested in any first world country for doing what they do. "
aimclp,eepn02b,"So Chinese thieves have stolen 20% of the world market? Congrats on your criminal behavior. Apple is still trouncing Chinese companies in every first world country that follows IP laws.
"
aimclp,eepaf24,"You realize that these companies are lying about sales numbers

The chinese economy is collapsing and the chinese government has been churning out fake gdp statistics for decades and forcing companies to lie about production and sales

"
aimclp,eeoyc95,I don't see how does this looks like a Tesla though. You could slap like a Kia badge on that and it will look acceptable. 
aimclp,eeuzf7j,The 3 SR is going to have 50kWh.. 3kWh difference. This knockoff doesn't have DC fast charging though (you can tell by the carge port).
aimclp,eep3joo,"I said nothing about the car, nor did I say the product was bad or unsuccessful. Relax buddy"
aimclp,eepf5gu,"So their mobile interface was actually quite different from android/ios, saying xbox copied sony is like saying nintendo copied atari, saying word and excel are copies is dumb, they're just word processing, hololens is totally different than google glass, DirectX is a totally different API than OpenGL and hardly a copy.

I'm not saying they didn't copy any products or ideas along the way, but saying they copied all their products is like saying dodge just copied ford, or that Tesla just copied Edison "
aimclp,eep790t,You do know how the industry works right? Everyone improves upon the existing version  until it‚Äôs different enough to put it out as their own. Improving != Copying. Whereas most Chinese companies blatantly copy the American counter parts. Seems like you really dislike Microsoft for some reason lmao
aimclp,eepm8m4,"Actually try reading sometime. Even more direct: 

As quoted above, Tesla‚Äôs agreement not to sue a party for patent infringement extends only ‚Äúfor so long as such party is acting in good faith.‚Äù The Pledge goes on to state that a party is acting in good faith as long as they have not:

asserted, helped others assert or had a financial stake in any assertion of (i) any patent or other intellectual property right against Tesla or (ii) any patent right against a third party for its use of technologies relating to electric vehicles or related equipment;
challenged, helped others challenge, or had a financial stake in any challenge to any Tesla patent; *or
marketed or sold any knock-off product (e.g., a product created by imitating or copying the design or appearance of a Tesla product or which suggests an association with or endorsement by Tesla) or provided any material assistance to another party doing so.*"
aimclp,eertoao,"And the windshield is a copy of the X, the camera on the windshield is a copy of the X, the screens are not only the same, with the trim around it looking the same, but also a copy of the interface, the steering wheel, the shift lever. No literally nothing like a Tesla..... /s"
aimclp,eep6l0r,There were about a million EV sales in China last year.  Tesla isn't really a market leader there.
aimclp,eev9eel,"> the EV industry. They are not going to steal many Tesla customers, but they will get all of the EV customers that can‚Äôt afford a

Exactly this. I would love to buy Tesla one day, but unless prices would go down massively I will not be able to afford it.I live in Poland,(average pay around 850Euro per month), so I have hopes that Chinese  cars would be available in Europe one day.

aimclp,eepm5b9,"Not when you use them to build Tesla knockoffs, try reading:

aimclp,eeph5j5,"We need to stop spreading this misinformation. They have a ""patent pledge."" It means, if you use their patent, they won't go after you. BUT, Tesla can now use all your patents. This is why it would make sense for a smaller company or a startup or one that didn't have significant IP. If GM or Ford or VW used a single Tesla patent, Tesla would be able to use all of theirs. And not just their patents, but trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and the like.

aimclp,eepylgx,Every patent in existence is publicly available 
aimclp,eep6mvv,"> All Tesla patents are publicly available.

Iirc youd still have to have some agreement. Its not that we (random internet users) can just read them."
aimclp,eephaxo,"There is no ""open source"" policy. It's a ""patent pledge."" It's a reciprocal agreement: We won't sue you, but (importantly) you can't sue us if we use your patents/trademarks/IP."
aimclp,eepmn6r,Haha. I'm not going to start lecturing the difference between Chinese dictator and Chinese people. In short it's not like we have a say in IP law or it's enforcement
aimclp,eeptyvh,"I have no opinion on whether it was okay or not to copy because I don't even accept the premise that it was a copy. 
"
aimclp,eepq7wl,"From your response,  I don't believe you've worked in R&D before.  The fastest growth comes from expanding on an existing design and not build from grounds up.  Imagine the wheel that was invented thousands of years ago.  If everyone had to come up with a different design each time, then we would still using a stone based material.  Tesla patents could be located here:  https://patents.justia.com/company/tesla and Elon mentioned that all of their stuff belongs to the people here: https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you.  With this in mind, I think theft and spying is a bit harsh of a description."

aimclp,eepmhpa,"The body of the car is identical to a Model 3. It's a knockoff.

"
aimclp,eepcf6j,"literally everything is made in china, what are you talking about"
aimclp,eet5d3y,"It's the same number of steps compared to my other cars.  Open hood, remove battery cover, remove negative terminal, remove positive terminal, remove bolt.  Just in the model 3 the battery cover is a plastic trim piece that you pull off.  You could argue that the battery location isn't obvious, but then I've had cars that put the battery in some pretty weird places.  On one car the first step was, jack front left corner and remove the left front wheel.  Now, if the battery is completely dead and you can't open the hood that is definitely a bit more complicated."
aimclp,eet5j8i,For the headlight on the Model S I've heard that problem is usually a bad local ground.
aimclp,eep6hlo,"Oh, they love it.  That's why companies like Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi own like 80% of the smartphone market in China while Apple is under 10% and shrinking fast.  Why pay a premium price for a western product when you can get something 90% as good for half the price from a Chinese company?  "
aimclp,eep6v19,"Yes, they are kicking Apple's ass by stealing sales with cheaper phones.  Apple's revenue is shrinking, Huawei's and Xiaomi's are going up.  "
aimclp,eer9psa,"> Apple is still trouncing Chinese companies in every first world country that follows IP laws.

I mean, Huawei now has a bigger market share in Europe than Apple, but you can keep believing whatever you want:
https://www.statista.com/statistics/632599/smartphone-market-share-by-vendor-in-europe/"
aimclp,eevap66,"The speculation is 55 kWh and we can expect it to be more efficient than that Leaf, the difference is larger than 3 kWh. It will also charge faster and have faster acceleration and likely higher top speed. This Chinese knockoff is a larger car so it needs a larger battery to get better range. Having a DC charging port doesn't mean we know the charge speed. Is it 100 kW or faster?"

Why is that?  I thought a company with growing revenue and profits was better than a company with slowing revenue and profits?  Like, if Apple is better than Huawei, wouldn't that mean GM, with its huge revenue and profits, is better than Tesla?  

Also, talking shit about Huawei phones is hilarious.  They are just as good as Apple products.  They are largely made by the same people, using the same components.  Apple just charges more for them.  "

So I would speculate further that if Tesla going to start making their own cells, it will not initially be at GF1.

My additional hunch is the Panasonic 18650 lines in Japan will start making 2170 cells for Tesla energy.

Long term the Panasonic lines at GF1 may be making cells for the Semi or Tesla energy...

But we are talking 3-5 years for the full transition...

SR Model 3 and Model Y will use cells from GF1 for sometime."

Gigafactory doesn't only produce electrodes.

It seems you have poor appreciation of the manufacturing process. And what Gigafactory does. Gigafactory manufacturers drivetrains too.

7ifdjd,dqyarr0,"You're gonna get a lot of skewed answers, given where you are. 

I'm going to tell you what I tell everyone - get really informed on both products and then pick the one that best fits your lifestyle.

If money is the prime motivator - get the Leaf. If charging options and speed are - get the Tesla. Utility - may be a toss up. Cutting edge tech - the Tesla. Repair ease - the Leaf. The list goes on and on. 

Obviously a lot more complicated than that, but I feel like anything beyond that just comes off as a bias. Ideally you'd sit in both, but the Tesla will be tougher on that front. 

I'd say make a list of features you care about most, and side by side it. Try to test drive both.

7ifdjd,dqycxdh,"I drive a 2011 Leaf with a battery that was replaced under warranty in 2016.  

You don't say where you live, but the Leaf's lack of battery heating and cooling is a real issue if you live anywhere hot or cold.  Cold weather is a doubly-whammy in this car, as you pay for heat and your battery loses capacity.  

I also wouldn't assume the Leaf is more reliable.  With 69k miles on my Leaf I have all kinds of cheap car creaks and groans, and I've replaced a power window motor out of pocket.  It doesn't feel like it was all that well put together.  Nissan was a real dick to early Leaf owners too, and only added a battery capacity warranty after being sued.  For a long time they claimed that the Leaf had no battery degradation issues, even in Arizona, when the owners had hard data showing otherwise.

I like my Leaf for what it is, but I'd never buy one new.  They feel like a disposable car to me.  Buy a used Leaf or lease it, because Nissan won't support it long term and the depreciation will be insane. 


Also the App is garbage. "
7ifdjd,dqybjmt,"As a current 2013 Leaf owner, I can't wait to move to a Tesla. The battery degradation on the Leaf feels like planned obsolescence. When it finally craps out around 2021, why would I put another 84 mile range battery in it? There will be no resale value. And it really ticks me off that they're sticking with CHAdeMO, when nearly every other manufacturer has switched to CCS.

Spend $5,000 more and get a base Model 3."
7ifdjd,dqyc50q,"I currently drive a 2013 Leaf, and it is a great car. We've decided to ditch my wife's ICE when our Model 3 reservation comes up (instead of the Leaf, as had been the original plan) because any electric car is substantially better than an ICE vehicle (as long as the range is sufficient for your needs). Already, if we are taking one vehicle, it is *always* the Leaf if the distance is within our range.

To your question, however, the issue becomes whether the added features of the Model 3 are worth enough to you to justify the added expense. 

How much is 70 (or 160 for LR) more miles of range worth? For my daily drive, the 60 miles I can comfortably get from a 2013 Leaf is sufficient. However, it is not enough to make some of the longer drives I routinely take (currently need to take the ICE for those). If 150-mile range is enough, the added value from the Model 3 here may be limited.

How much is performance worth to you? My 2013 Leaf is already more fun to drive than any ICE I've had, but the jump to the Model 3 is more than a small jump.

What is access to the Supercharger network worth? I have only charged on public stations a few times (largely because my rural area doesn't have any level-three yet), and you may be surprised how much of your typical driving you can do while only charging at home. As with range, if you regularly drive longer distances, this will be worth more.

The controls are a matter of taste, but that is still worth something. I am a far bigger fan of the configurable nature of Tesla (and the lack of ICE relic control systems), but I am not sure how much that is worth to me.

The Leaf will likely cover 90% of your driving needs without much problem. The trouble arises from the other 10% of the needs. If you have ready access to another vehicle, you can just use that to cover those times. But, I know that I get frustrated when I have to go back to the ancient ICE technology just because I am going somewhere behind the range of my Leaf.

In contrast, I expect that the Model 3 will cover nearly all of my needs, with only a minor added inconvenience of charging on long road trips. It is likely to be sufficient as an only car for most drivers, and that is worth something as well.

So, what is a guy to do? Buy one of each ;)  I expect the Model 3 will be our go-to car for everything, with the Leaf only being driven when we really need a second car (e.g., for me to take to and from work, or to drive while the other has taken the Model 3 already).

7ifdjd,dqyb82b,Any good videos of ProPilot in the wild yet?
7ifdjd,dqydea4,"Everyone else has good points, I just want to address the 360 camera (which I also want): Tesla doesn‚Äôt have it currently, but they have cameras all around the car that make it possible. It could be a software update down the road, and I think it‚Äôs a top requested feature on the list. Until then you do have backup camera and parking sensors that show you how far away from object in inches (and it‚Äôs accurate), as well as auto perpendicular and parallel park."
7ifdjd,dqyxix3,"We really can't go wrong here (in my opinion), because if you get the Leaf, everyone behind you moves up in line for the Model 3. If you get the Model 3, you don't have to drive around in a Leaf. So either way, win-win.   ;-)"
7ifdjd,dqyi8zh,"2013 Leaf owner. Some points:

* It is better than ICE, comfortable and gets us from A to B (as long as it's within range )
* Originally came with 2G internet, which AT&T killed last December. They offer a $200 TCU upgrade, but apparently it's been killing people's 12V battery, so no thanks. That means the app is not usable at all unless I risk a battery killing hardware upgrade. Thanks Nissan.
* I have 32k miles (I bought it 16 months ago with 12k miles). So far still have 12 bars of battery, but I'm not expecting this car to be of much use by 100k miles. 
* The car was ""futuristic"" in 2011. Now it's outdated. There is nothing Nissan is going to do to make this car better or do more things. 
* It's good for around town. I am glad I got it (sold my 2009 Honda Fit with 112k miles that needed service for $4k less than I paid for the Leaf, I've saved a ton in fueling and maintenance costs and it's much more fun and comfortable).
* There are quite a few places to charge (but I live outside a ""green"" city). Problem is, I've had multiple times that I've pulled up to charge and the charging station doesn't work and I have to find another one before I can make it home. Talk about inconvenient. Wouldn't be so bad in a 160 mile Leaf, but I would worry about it still.

Summary. I'd consider a new one as our second car, but only if they offered the $10k off deals that were being offered recently in my state for the 2017 models. I would rather spend more on a Tesla that is nicer looking, much quicker, has supercharging, offers Autopilot that will only get better and better with time, and will get many other improvements over the air for free."
7ifdjd,dqycwze,I'd be careful about leafs being more reliable.. My co-worker is on his 3rd leaf already.. 1st leaf - Battery degradation .They offered a very good deal for him to upgrade so he did. 2nd leaf - Electronics were always on which killed the 12 volt battery. Nissan tried to fix it until it lemoned out... 
7ifdjd,dqycxex,You could probably get a 2-3 year lease on the LEAF and get a Model 3 when you are done without much of a line. That's what I would do if I weren't already in lineatm
7ifdjd,dqyet07,"If you view a car as solely a means to get you from point A to point B, get a leaf.  If you like driving and sporty cars, get a Model 3."
7ifdjd,dqyxi87,"Unless you plan to run the leaf into the ground, get a Tesla. The battery degradation alone will make the $5000 seem like nothing at resale time. I‚Äôd suspect you‚Äôd be down to 80% capacity on the leaf in less than 10 years, likely ~5. If you are strictly getting it as a city / commute car, then sure maybe. 

TLDR:
Your resale value in 10 years will likely be 5k more for the Tesla than the Leaf. "
7ifdjd,dqyb1is,"This! The Supercharger network is one of the biggest pluses for Tesla. If you plan on doing road trips in the car, keep that in mind. (If it's not very often, you could always rent a car for a few days when doing those road trips)."

6yy91t,dmr33ou,"Ok, I'll continue this here... EDIT: For those wondering, this was already posted but was quickly removed, but not before OP and I had some back and forth.

I think most of your confusion comes from the fact that you think that kilowatt-hour are kilowatts per hour when in fact it is kilowatts times hour.  This confusion is shown where you say ""seems like measuring a gas tank with the unit gallons per hour * hour.""

If you really want to think about it with a ""per hour"", think kilowatt hours per hour.  Obviously, the hours cancel out, but it is a valid way to think of it.

> battery holds some amount of watts ""an hour.""

No, it holds an amount of kilowatt hours, not kilowatts per hour."
6yy91t,dmr74qr,"I've honestly never figured out how to explain to technically minded people why watt-hours and watts are so confusing to the average person. I have a science background and know *why* it is the way it is, but like you said, the time component in a unit for quantity of something just confuses people. 

All I ever get in return for bringing this up is an explanation that a watt-hour is the energy equivalent of 1 watt of power being expended over an hour. Which I already know!

Basically, electrical engineers are so used to this unit, that it's become intuitive for them to work with and simply can't fathom why it's confusing. It's just convention and it doesn't look likely to change. 

On the other hand, consumers don't care at the moment whether they incorrectly say kW or kWh because they're usually just looking at a power rating of an appliance or their energy bill. So they are never in a situation where they have to use one to workout the other with regards to time.

Edit: Sorry you're getting down votes. I agree with you, but it's just one of those things where the people that are used to these units don't see a problem, and the ones who use it incorrectly think they're using it correctly, so no problem. Not much can be done. One hopes that EVs might bring a situation where people need to workout between watts and watt-hours with respect to time, highlighting the unintuitive-ness of these units, but since the software already does that for them with a time estimate, I don't see things changing."
6yy91t,dmr3h2t,"This is easy. Electricity in the USA is rated in kWh. My household bill is X cents a kWh. My meter shows me using X kW an hour. This unit is already universal. You think the average consumer in the USA is more comfortable with joules than kWh? 

Also, batteries are pretty universally measured in AH and volts, and multiplying those gets you watts, so it's pretty native. Nothing about those gets you to joules as easily. Consumers have become pretty comfortable with cell phone batteries as ""2,300 mAh"" not ""28,800"" joules. Yes, mAh is not a energy measurement, but it's been bastardized because the assumption is a Li-Ion battery and thus a similar voltage, so that's the simplest number that lets you compare two packs. At least Tesla doesn't try and tell you the pack is a 27,000 AH pack ;)

I don't get what's hard about it. The battery holds 60-75-90-100 kWh of energy. Your charger charges at 10, 20, 100, 300 kWh per hour. Yes, killowatt hours per hour, which is killowatts, which is a rate. So if you have a 100 kWh pack and charge at 20 kWh/h, it will take 5 hours. That's no different than if I have a 20 gallon gas tank and I fill it at 20 gallons per hour. It's also convenient because if you know you pay 10 cents a kWh, and you have a 90 kWh battery, a charge will be $9.

Ignore the units and your fine. The Tesla holds 100 of something. The charger charges at 20 of those an hour, and you discharge at 0.3 of them per mile. I don't see the average consumer having that much of an issue, and joules will make the heads of average USA owners explode. Joules almost sound communist ;)"

I believe I have a firm grasp on what the units mean and how they interwork, but I never thought about *why* they are the way they are.  Could you elaborate why in electrical engineering circles watts is a conceptual base unit rather than joules?

I thought plenty on the orientation of charges, i.e.  on why electrons are negative such that electrical engineers tend to think in holes, which is really annoying.  However, I never put thought towards why watts is a common base unit rather than joules.

6yy91t,dmre8cj,"It's a measurement, like horsepower but simpler.  Horsepower is also something few people actually understand, but they know it measures something with cars even if they have no idea that foot pounds per second measurement they call ""horsepower"" actually does have time factored into it for real.  If it helps you understand it better with that confusing but more familiar measuring unit, you can estimate 1 horsepower as 746 watts or so.  Of course that's wrong, horsepower has so many different values so you can't actually pin it down unless you specify the exact type of horsepower unit you're actually talking about... but that's even more confusing so we ignore all of the definitions and everybody just kind of accepts horsepower blindly without any need to understand what it actually means or measures or stands for in anything but the most abstract way.

See what I'm getting at here?  "
6yy91t,dngjmhq,"Disclaimer: When I say ‚ÄúI know‚Äù, I actually mean ‚ÄúI can guess why it happened‚Äù The simple answer is convention. Kinda like how sailors use knots. 

With most electrical engineering applications, you‚Äôre nearly always dealing with power (rate of energy flow) because it‚Äôs the product of potential (volts) and current (amps). So when you have a component that consumes energy at a certain rate (watts) and you want to work out how much energy it will consume over 3 hours, you just multiply its power by 3 and you get the energy quantity in terms of watts. 

I‚Äôm having trouble putting into words why they‚Äôd want to get the quantity in terms of watts, but I guess it‚Äôs sort of like lightyears. We talk about distances in space in terms of how many years light would take to cover that distance. In the same way, electrical engineers talk about energy quantity in terms of what rate of flow would this much energy require to transfer in an hour (or how many hours it would take for this energy to transfer at 1 watt). 

Edit: Worth remembering that, for example, 3 Wh can be seen as a quantity of energy that would take 1 hour to transfer at 3 W or as a quantity of energy that would take 3 hours to transfer at 1 W. That‚Äôs one of the cool things about Wh as a ‚Äúmultiplied‚Äù unit vs a typical ‚Äúdivided‚Äù unit like mph.

Hope that made sense. Might be rambling a bit. "
6yy91t,dmr5203,"No, it's just kW. kW is a rate, which is what a charger does. In fuel, this is Gallons Per Hour. You can't have kW/h. A watt is a joule per second, so a kW per hour would be 1000 watts per second per hour. 

kWh = Gallons
kWh per hour = kWh/h = kW = Gallons per hour

100 kWh ""tank"" charged at 10 kW will take 10 hours
100 gallon tank ""charged"" at 10 gallons per hour will take 10 hours
"
6yy91t,dmr55i8,"No, in that example, after charging for one hour you'd get 15kW*1h = 15kWh. Or, if you charge for 2 hours you'd have 30kWh. kW is a rate, kWh is a capacity."
6yy91t,dmr4zss,"If a car is charging at 15 kW, that is 15 kWh/h. 

A kWh is the amount of energy you produce by sustaining a transfer of 1 kW for 1 hour."
6yy91t,dmrb1pu,"Watt-hours is watts accumulated over an hour.  

It's ""water through X inch hose at Y psi for an hour is XY-hour "", where:  
- X is amperage  
- Y is voltage  
- X times Y is wattage  
- and X times Y times 1 hour is inch-psi-hour, or maybe few times gallons.  

OP is insisting that we call it in gallons instead of ""X times Y times an hour"" but that drops the information as to how thick is the hose, and since everything is already measured in hose thickness and max pressure it'll just make everyone's job complicated.

6yy91t,dngl6g5,"I think I follow.  Once you framed it that way, everything came into view in a way that makes sense for me:

Buildings and bridges are interesting when everything is static.  How far your car is about to go, and how far it went, are both interesting when nothing is moving.  However, electrical devices are relatively useless if there's no change in energy and everything is static.  Just about all the electrical engineering work revolves around when charges are moving around.  Thus, the base conceptual unit is in terms of *change* over time, such as amperage (change in energy over time) and wattage (change in energy over time).  Voltage is not in terms of change over time because, in the most simplified intro-to-EE scenarios, it is static between two reference points.

There's some abstract beauty when viewing the world that way, I think.

Thanks!

6yy91t,dmrgtem,"No more than they'll wonder why their horses power time.  You're overthinking something new and underthinking things that are old.  That was the point of why I pointed out your error using my example of horsepower.  You've blindly accepted horsepower without understanding it is ***exactly*** the complaint you attribute to kwh:  It does have time factored into it which you told us is confusing to you.    The only reason you let horsepower slide but not kwh is because one is newer to you and you never thought to question the other.  

Look up horsepower; kwh is a far easier to understand unit of measure.  Nobody cares though, just like you didn't care or realize how confusing horsepower was.

Consequently, this is also why ""miles per hour"" is rapidly becoming a conversational unit of of charge.  It bypasses all confusion and makes understanding simple and obvious, regardless of the charge source or type.  300 mph supercharging is understandably faster than 3 mph socket power even if I never mention any legitimate technical terms."
6yy91t,dmrrqyd,"Man, is it that hard to distinguish between someone who is confused about something and someone pointing out a concept that is confusing? I understood what you meant perfectly. Seemed to fly over everyone else's heads as they jumped in to start mansplaining to you what you already know."
6yy91t,dmrrg5y,"My point about horsepower is that consumers never need to understand them. The only time I hear about (and blindly accept) horsepower is when someone says ""this muscle car has 1.21 horsepower"" and I say ""sure whatever"" because it's just a meaninglessness number to me. No one has ever said ""this charger is 5 horsepower and your battery is 28 horsepower hour, how long is it going to take to charge?""

If I had to do that type of calculation with horsepower I would  want a less confusing unit.

MPH works because time is in the right place: time should be on the charger and not in the car. MPH chargers get you Miles in your car. That's exactly what people expect and exactly the opposite of kW chargers getting you kWhs in your car.

What's confusing isn't the unit, it's that we're using a unit for power when consumers are interested in energy. If kWh was given a new unit, it wouldn't be backwards. I have mentioned this before. Say 1 Wh = 1 Whit. Then a 6 kW charger would be 6 Whit's per hour and a 60 kWh battery would be 60 Whit's.

Technically the exact same units and same math, but it measures energy instead of power which aligned with what people want."
6yy91t,dmrx3k1,"Precisely, you understand that consumers never need to understand.  Finally we agree.  

This is exactly why miles per hour is the defacto standard of charge time in consumer conversation now.  Consumers have never and will never care about understanding terms, and have created that conversational unit simply because electric charging is still slow.  You can do the miles per hour thing for your ICE car as well, if you want.  The only difference is it goes faster right now, fast enough that nobody bothers.

As superchargers keep increasing in speed, and as other brands catch up in fast charge as well, the entire concept will vanish anyway.  Charging will absolutely catch up to liquid fuel in times to recharge, at that point your question is as useful as ""how many gallons per second does this pump deliver?  However, kwh will still matter, because that is the unit of storage - the equivalent of how many gallons your gas tank can hold.  You'll always need to know that even if you don't know what it means because when you buy a truck and you drive 400 miles a day you're not going to buy the one with the 7 gallon gas tank because you need the 20 gallon tank instead.  You know it'll take longer to fill the 20 gallon tank up, but you don't care about the gallons per minute math behind that difference.

In the interim where you still want to understand, kwh = gallons.  Don't do any math, just look at it that way.  The number of kwh is how many gallons your gas tank can hold.  Fewer gallons means shorter range, faster kwh delivery means more gallons per second delivery by your gas pump.

That's it, ELI5 as simple as I can for you.  "
6yy91t,dmrz615,"I do agree that consumers don't need to understand the unit.

But I disagree that they don't need to understand how to _use_ it. Until all chargers are as fast as gas pumps, people will care a _lot_ about the charging speed, and that means doing math with the EVSE kW and your cars kWh. 

The reason MPH is the de-facto standard is not because ""consumers never need to understand."" It's because MPH's base unit is ""Miles"" which measures _energy_, which is what consumers care about, rather than measuring _power_ which consumers don't care about except in relation to the energy their car can contain.

>""However, kwh will still matter, because that is the unit of storage""

This is what I keep trying to get at. kWh is not a unit, it's an equation: the unit _times an hour_. The base unit of kWh is kW. And to get a storage unit out of kW, you have to multiply it by time. I honestly can't tell if you understand that that's been my point from the beginning. 

Which of the following imaginary units are simpler?

> My car battery is 50 zapflops, and I have a charger that charges at 20 zapflops per hour.   
 
> My car battery is 50 hopzapp hours, and I have a charger that charges at 20 hopzapps. 

For comparison, which of these do you expect your grandma to understand at first glance without having it explained to her?

> My car tank is 50 gallons, and the pump is about 20 gallons / minute.   
 
> My car tank is 50 gulpo-hours, and the pump is about 20 gulpos. 



"
6yy91t,dmrzwkj,"Yes, miles per hour already covers that.  Very few people have no idea what the range of their car is, and when they forget the car will remind them.  That's exactly why miles per hour is the adopted standard across all brands, most set the display to miles rather than %.  If they don't use miles per hour they use kw because they probably know their kwh capacity which is just as easy as miles per hour.

You're trying to manufacture confusion where there is none.

Your grandmother will not understand either statement and won't want to try and understand whatever it is you suggest instead, that's why she uses miles per hour.  That way she can simply understand charge time based on the kwh capacity of her specific car.  If she refuses to read that capacity as either miles or kwh she will forever be as confused as you seem to be, but once she sees that capacity - whether she reads it as kwh or as miles - -she calculates how long it takes to charge in her head with no difficulty."

No other auto manufacturers are on par with them, technologically, I think. As such, the price premium puts me in a car that I call ""my dream car"", and I was never a car guy.

96qvta,e43fguy,"Wow, Ultra White seats too? That looks very sleek. I want ultra white but she wants cream interior. How is the white holding up?"
96qvta,e42j8t6,"I've also charged at: Burbank (Town Center Mall, not the SC), Thousand Oaks, San Bernardino, and San Clemente. Never waited at any of them. Burbank gets filled up sometimes, but I still never waited (mid-day, right after lunch). "
96qvta,e42v3gn,"I think San Diego is rough because they have a lot of Tesla owners down there, but they also have a few commercial services that charge Teslas at the Superchargers (even despite Tesla saying they need to stop). Before 2018, they only had the 12 stall Supercharger north of SD, but now they have a 16 stall Supercharger right in downtown. Even still, they need more options."
96qvta,e43fqy3,"I have one spot on the passenger side front seat that I can't seem to get out, and it's a mark or stain of some kind. The driver's side seat has held up very well, although my keys being on my left belt loop has caused some slight wear.

Whatever the Tesla people tell you about white is completely true. I have spilled small amount of fruit punch, coffee, wiped a ball point pent by accident on the white leather, and I was able to wipe it away using moist wipes. I try to take care of it, but accidents happen. "

96qvta,e42xb68,"The Glendale Supercharger has similar issues: pay to park (I think 2 hours free with validation, or longer with validation), and difficult to find (they're on a higher up floor with no signage indicating where they are). The urban chargers are nice, and I appreciate how quickly they're deployed, but the premium to get in sometimes kills the appeal."

96qvta,e43f9q3,"Americana glendale SC is free for the first hr, yesterday I charged from 67mi to 150mi in 27 min"
96qvta,e42xszd,"The Supercharger Fontana is built, ready for use, but SoCal Edison needs to install the transformer and energize the location. 23-24 stalls in a Target parking lot (well, CVS, but right next to the Target), eagerly waiting for it to open so I can stop driving to Rancho Cucamonga SC. "
1c1pmgp,kz5r2om,Isn‚Äôt it ‚ÄòAssertive‚Äô?
1c1pmgp,kz8fd8x,"I typically leave it in assertive because I‚Äôm in NJ where if you leave too big a gap, EVERYONE will cut in front of you. My biggest gripe is with the auto speed offset it tries to do 35+ through 25mph zones, which isn‚Äôt ideal when you live near like 3 speed trap towns. I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs related to the assertive driving mode though."
1c1pmgp,kzcrurd,"When I first got 12.3, the default mode irritated me so much... in the right lane, onramp on right is coming up... it changes lanes to the left lane... then after 5 seconds, decided to change back where it was originally.

It did crap like this all the time.

I put it on chill and minimize lane changes and I am happy now. Though nothing is as much as a puckerfest as making an unprotected left turn and the car wants to ""shoot the gap"" in oncoming traffic to complete the turn.  Personally, I would not have done it - it was a safe turn though, I just was surprised on how the car hustled through the turn."
1c1pmgp,kz56op8,Chill because of battery and power consumption.
1c1pmgp,kz5rf95,"You are right it is assertive, but it doesn‚Äôt let me change anymore."
1c1pmgp,kz8rqnw,It doesn't actually affect that.
1c1pmgp,kz5rk6c,Same difference ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug)
1c1pmgp,kz9psem,I have been getting better mileage with chill compared to normal.
1c1pmgp,kz9src3,"It doesn't change your acceleration though, so it shouldn't affect your range. It just changes your follow distance and how often you make passes on the highway."
1c1pmgp,kzikcau,"https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/2012_2020_models/en_jo/GUID-E692415D-F83C-4F07-B30A-9E50499CFC30.html#:~:text=Chill%3A%20limits%20acceleration%20for%20a,vehicles%20equipped%20with%20Autopilot%20hardware).



Chill: limits acceleration for a smooth and gentle ride (available on all vehicles equipped with Autopilot hardware).
Standard: provides the normal level of acceleration (available on non-Performance All-Wheel Drive vehicles and Rear Wheel Drive Model S vehicles equipped with Autopilot hardware).

Even though Tesla claims it does not impact the range between chill and standard, range is impacted in other modes such as sport or ludicrous. So, I still think there is an impact to the range. But it depends on other conditions such as city driving where you stop and accelerate more often vs highway driving."
1c1pmgp,kzn2786,"You're talking about the ""chill"" acceleration mode setting. That's not what we're talking about here. We're talking about the ""chill"" FSD setting, which is a completely different thing."
1c1pmgp,kzn8q6j,Got it.
1cn71l1,l3br7oy,"I think they would need to train separate models for that setting to work with V12, and I doubt they're doing that currently. So it only works with V11 since that uses a hand-coded architecture, and V11 is only enabled on highways right now."
1donvp9,lab4ady,"If you‚Äôre getting this many strikes, you‚Äôre either not paying the proper attention while you‚Äôre driving, or there‚Äôs a hardware problem with your steering wheel or cabin camera. 

If you think it‚Äôs a hardware problem, there‚Äôs nothing this sub can really help with and you should a schedule service appointment. 

If it‚Äôs attention, only you can fix your driving habits. I‚Äôve had exactly one strike in 2 years, and it was because I had to exceed the 85mph limit to pass a truck on a road trip. 

A strike does not happen instantaneously and without warning. You get visual reminders, and eventually audio and visual reminders, before you get a strike."
1donvp9,lab2194,You should probably pay attention when behind the wheel of a car.
1donvp9,labhsyt,"How can you guys be getting this notifications is what I can‚Äôt comprehend .. 

more than a year using FSD and autopilot, not once have I ever gotten such warning..

I swear some of you drivers are reason why we can‚Äôt have nice things.. how hard is it to pay fuckn attention that you are on the road with other human drivers.. 

The other day I saw a driver all leaned back and on his phone.. while his car is in FSD mode.. you are one of those aren‚Äôt you.."
1donvp9,lab3hdv,"I‚Äôve used FSD since May 2023, as has my wife. Daily. And we haven‚Äôt ever even gotten a single strike. I‚Äôm always so curious how people get strikes. I‚Äôm tempted to try to get one just to see how it happens."
1donvp9,lab6xau,Drive better
1donvp9,lab2xoj,I thought there is a rule. One week incident free and a strike gets removed.
1donvp9,ladmlox,"I totally 100% agree with this and I think there is an update that addresses this. I had four strikes that I received on regular auto steer (Lord knows how much much easier it is to get a strike on auto steer versus FSD) and went two months without receiving any strikes at all. Signed up for FSD for one month for my road trip. Received my fifth strike on my way back. Strike was my fault. I‚Äôm not saying that I didn‚Äôt do wrong. I should have been paying attention, but it still does not seem fair that I paid $100 for this and now I‚Äôm only getting three weeks given that my last strike was so long ago."
1donvp9,lab7c2p,"I usually get my strikes on long road trips because of multiple red steering wheels nags. It‚Äôs from changing songs/playlist on Spotify a lot and trying to add a stop while driving. Yes, I immediately correct it. it remembers how many times it nagged you until you put the car in park."
1donvp9,lab5b6s,"For me it happened when my alignment was off. Car would accuse me of having a steering wheel defeat device, I presume because there was always a constant torque to the right. I got locked out twice, and it drove me nuts because I was keeping not one, but two hands on the wheel since it was happening so often. But there was no rhyme or reason to the strikes- just instant strike with no warning every now and again. Not even a gray screen to gently remind me to touch the wheel (since I was always touching it).

2020 Model S, if it matters."
1donvp9,lacdmyq,"Don‚Äôt be so judgemental and just ASSume that I am one of those people. Even my sister in law had hers disabled for a week and by no means is she one of these drivers you mention about. Just like others have mentioned, trying to add a destination on your trip or changing the music while looking away prompts it to flash and nag at you‚Ä¶ and if you don't correct your actions within a few seconds then it will ding you quickly. She has 2 little boys in the car too. And no I do not have my seat leaned back texting with both my hands while FSD drives. You swear I got disabled 4 times in a day. This is over a span of months. And nobody is perfect! And never say never to those who said it has never happened to you. With the prior versions of FSD, it was incessantly nagging at every lil thing. Good thing they reduced it."
1donvp9,lab4kkz,Ignore the screen if/when it alerts you and play on your phone or just don't watch the road and you'll get them quite quickly.
1donvp9,lab523h,"Unless there‚Äôs a legitimate hardware problem, people are getting strikes because they aren‚Äôt paying adequate attention. It‚Äôs really that simple. The system provides so many opportunities for warning before a strike happens. 

The only exception to this that I‚Äôm aware of where a strike is instant is exceeding the FSD/AP max speed limit of 85mph. 

I know this because I‚Äôve had exactly one strike in 2 years of using FSD, and it was because I pressed on the accelerator to pass a truck on a road trip and it locked me out immediately.

EDIT: Also the defeat device lockout happens without warning, but again, either you‚Äôre not using a defeat device and you have a hardware problem; or you are using a defeat device and you **should** be getting locked out for that."
1donvp9,lab3vo7,I got one for not paying attention to the screen. I had my hands lightly on the wheel and was looking at the road while ignoring the blue flashing light. Then It was disabled for the rest of the drive :(
1donvp9,lab3w86,"That is supposed to be a change within 2024.20.1 once ""you"" update to it."
1donvp9,lab33df,I don‚Äôt know. But my incidents haven‚Äôt gone down at all.
1donvp9,lab6gep,"Yeah the defeat device lockout and exceeding the max FSD/AP speed are the only two things I‚Äôm aware of that give you a strike without warning. 

But as you mentioned, your bad alignment throwing the defeat device lockout is a great example of what could be a legit hardware problem that could cause this. And if that‚Äôs the case, Tesla service is who the OP needs to diagnose and resolve the issue. 

Speaking more broadly though of these types of posts, not necessarily the OP here, but I think a lot of people vastly overestimate how attentive they are when driving, or what is ‚Äòsafe‚Äô. 

I‚Äôm sure every person has had an experience with someone who thinks themselves a ‚Äòsafe driver‚Äô, only to sit in the passenger seat with them in horror as they text on their phone or consistently not pay attention to traffic in front of them braking until way too late."
1donvp9,lace3i1,And plus at least I have FSD. imagine all the other human drivers you have to drive with on the road in gas powered automobiles. They are fucking more dangerous drivers when they text and drive with no FSD in their cars. You don‚Äôt have to worry about me. I have been driving for 22 years and have a spotless driving record. Never been in an accident nor caused one.
1donvp9,ladn6fz,"Or in my case you can ignore the screen, glance down at your nails because you‚Äôre a nail biter which could be mistaken for looking at your phone it appears. Either way keep your eyes on the road"
1donvp9,lab6y2a,"It doesn't give you a strike anymore. It just disables FSD until you pull off the road, put it in park, and re-enable it.

It happened to me on a recent road trip. I had no idea it would do that, and I needed to get further away from an 18-wheeler so that I could get in the right lane and let cars pass.

I checked the strike list later that day and it did not say I had any strikes. I checked it again a few days ago and it also did not show any strikes.

Edit: I should add that I do not have the upgrade yet that removes the strikes."
1donvp9,labnq7f,"If you use a defeat device it will tell you ""remove defeat device"" once it senses it. It gives you several warnings before it strikes/disengages for it. And once it has detected one, it looks/tests for it more frequently."
1donvp9,lab6v5a,"Just stay off your phone and drive, how is it that hard."
1donvp9,lab7bye,Oh interesting - well then I am resetting my lifetime strike count to 0! But all the more reason there‚Äôs really no excuse for strikes unless there‚Äôs a problem with the hardware.
1donvp9,lab81hq,"I have had the car randomly give me one of the red warnings to apply steering pressure. I have very good peripheral vision and can see the blue flashing on the screen. These warnings did not have any blue flashing at all.

I don't know what frequency you have to be warned at for it to strike you on FSD, but it doesn't seem like a set number. I had those warnings occur a bunch of times during the road trip and never got kicked out.

When it tells me to apply steering force, I have to apply almost enough force to break the fsd wheel lock. That's too much force to apply regularly, which is why I get that warning often."

14mf3yv,jq1ivks,Yes; you don‚Äôt have to wait. They removed the waitlist a while back so you just turn it on and you‚Äôre good to go.
14mf3yv,jq1h51i,Congrats. Be prepared to get honked at and take over. I subscribed for a month to try it out last month. It‚Äôs weird something it did great and others it failed horribly.
14mf3yv,jq1jooc,minimal lane change : nope. I am changing the lane now!!
14mf3yv,jq1oqpl,"There are different ‚Äúbranches‚Äù of the FSD beta. 2023.7, 2023.12 etc. They don‚Äôt get updated all at the same time, and most times they are not the same (2023.7 is on 11.4.4 whilst 2023.20 is on 11.3.6) 
Easiest way to find out is through the sites notateslaapp.com or teslafi.com"
14mf3yv,jq1oywk,"Hey OP, do you remember if your software version has changed before and after you have subscribed? I've read Tesla started merging the Master branch and FSD branch. So I am guessing the FSD was included in your installed version and the feature was enabled when you subscribed."
14mf3yv,jq2cnx5,Where do you go in the current software to request the beta? I can't find any way to request it on my new Model S. I got it on my previous (pre-refresh) Model S 2 years ago and I can't remember where in the menus I requested it (it also may have moved).
14mf3yv,jq1fzpx,That's exciting I can't wait to try it.  It's good to know that you pretty much get an instantly now or at least I got lucky.  Any good sources for configuration preferences?  I read the user's manual online and it really doesn't have anything useful.
14mf3yv,jq1jfbr,"I had heard that, but then I saw postings of people complaining that they didn't get beta right away. That was my confusion point. And also the screen that I'm seeing doesn't match any of the ones I've seen in any of the YouTube videos I've watched for the beta software."
14mf3yv,jq1ib3n,Yeah I think I'll definitely have to pay much more attention with FSD than with autopilot based on the few videos I've watched and the postings I've read.  Especially till I learn what it's challenge areas are.
14mf3yv,jq1qi47,The time from subscribing to getting to my car to check was about an hour. And my software was 2023.12.11 before and after.  My car didn't have access to Wi-Fi to update.
14mf3yv,jq2g6yu,I never requested it. I subscribe to FSD then went down to my car an hour later and on the screen it said would you like to try FSD beta and I clicked yes and that was it. I wanted it and I was actually going down to request it but I didn't have to.
14mf3yv,jq1h7h5,"Works best in assertive for me, with the one caveat that it will not leave the left lane on the interstate. Just use the turn signal to get back to the right when you‚Äôd like to."
14mf3yv,jq1jzgt,"The UI change is fairly recent, maybe that‚Äôs why. I‚Äôm not sure what you mean about the posts, but there‚Äôs definitely no waitlist to join anymore."
14mf3yv,jq1s3bz,"Yep. 2023.12.11 has FSD 11.3.6 as per https://www.notateslaapp.com/software-updates/. So, most likely the feature was just enabled when you subscribed. When you hear others say they had to wait for a couple of days to a week, they were most likely on a version which did not have FSD"
14mf3yv,jq34guh,"Hmm. I got a free 3-month trial of FSD with my new Model S, but don‚Äôt see any offer to try the Beta anywhere."
14mf3yv,jq1i104,"Thanks, good to know.  I'm pretty sure it's going to be a big learning experience just like autopilot was. Now that I've learned how autopilot behaves I know what I need to do to make it drive smoothly. I'm sure they'll be even more things I'll need to be aware of with FSD."
14mf3yv,jq39rc3,"It does get out of the left lane if theres a car behind you, but otherwise you are right it will camp the left lane."
14mf3yv,jq1kyez,What I was talking about on the post is people say they have subscribed to FSD and they weren't getting beta right away.  These were within the past month. The explanation seemed to be based on whatever current level of the software they are on for the car beforehand causing them to get stuck in a wait position.   Other posts said that you had to be connected to Wi-Fi to get it. I wasn't on Wi-Fi so I was kind of surprised to see it.
14mf3yv,jq1l7yx,"Remember, this is a beta. Warning: It's not going to drive smoothly."
14mf3yv,jq1lqem,"Maybe it has something to do with HW4 or newer cars having the 2023 software? I think FSD Beta is still labeled as 2022, so those wouldn‚Äôt get it since it‚Äôd be a downgrade. That‚Äôs my interpretation of what you‚Äôre saying. It could be something else though. I‚Äôm certainly not an expert."
14mf3yv,jq1lqo6,"Retired software engineer, so totally aware of what a beta is. The main reason I sub for it was because I have an injury that makes using the steering wheels for long period of time very uncomfortable. So anyway I can minimize that is worth a shot. Autopilot does a pretty decent job for most of my travels. But going to test this and see, that's why I sub instead of paying for it in full.  I suspect I may be subbing and canceling on and off a few times a year to see how much progress is made. Or maybe for the places that I go it may work really well. Only testing will tell."
14mf3yv,jq1lyks,"Yeah it could be that. But when the screen didn't match any of the videos I saw online, I never actually found a non-beta video to see what it would look like. But a lot of settings that they talk about in the videos on YouTube I couldn't find. I think they've just been renamed and consolidated."
zul7t9,j1k1ycb,"EAP has Navigate on Autopilot.  That helps the merging and whatnot that you mention about.  It‚Äôs also yo to the right side to do their merge. That‚Äôs why those merging in have a yeild. 

Lastly, these are driver assist.  Not replace.  If you don‚Äôt feel safe in a situation, take over before it becomes a close call."
zul7t9,j1k5qs7,"FSD Beta isn‚Äôt used on highways quite yet so we don‚Äôt have a great idea how it handles those merged.

I‚Äôd expect better, because basic AP really has no ability to negotiate with other vehicles."
zul7t9,j1nhmrb,"I usually bump up the follow distance in those situations, it works well if someone merges like normal. If you can tell that the person is going to dive in at the last second or shove their way in then just take control. 

The car is really smart about people changing lanes in front of you but it doesn‚Äôt seem to consider a car as merging until it sees it start to cross the lane lines. If its set to 2 or 3 it‚Äôll drive to its set follow distance and won‚Äôt make room for the other car until they touch the lines (especially with no blinker). If its set to 4 or 5 it‚Äôll leave plenty of room for people who jump in (and it closes the gap in very slow traffic so you don‚Äôt have a massive space in front of you)."
13p9h9d,jl9lvvz,"I'd suggest trying to call them, leave voicemail or messages for them to call you back if no one picks up, or if possible to just show up in person to ask them what's the problem. It's always best to show up in person.
When I first took delivery of my MX back in mid-March, I had issues with my left FWD (sensing phantom objects) and the SC was able to fix it in 2 days. They fixed it by removing the inside overpaint and replaced the USS."
13p9h9d,jl97s12,Are you asking us how to have a conversation with another adult? Have you tried asking them directly and assertively for more details?
13p9h9d,jl9fv08,"Unfortunately service center horror stories are pretty common. I experienced it myself.

For starters I suggest you take screenshots of all interactions on the Tesla app, because communications between you and them have a funny way of disappearing. It helps if you can document your experiences with screen shot evidence. Also make sure to get the full name of each person you speak or interact with, because different Tesla people will tell you completely contradictory things about the same issue.

You can also try calling the service center, or like I ended up having to do, appear in person at the service center and start asking questions. 

My issue was initially estimated to take a few days to repair, it ended up being a full month before I got my car back, and then 3 more months after that before things were resolved with the insurance company. At one point a Tesla person called out of the blue to threaten me with a collection agency, only to have the next person disavow all knowledge. 

It‚Äôs a stressful and infuriating experience and I wish you luck. Maybe things will turn around and you‚Äôll have your car back soon."
13p9h9d,jla1oxb,They either found an issue and waiting for a part or they broke something and waiting for a part.
e1jpg2,f8po4rf,So what your saying is the cyber truck can speed and chp can‚Äôt see how fast you‚Äôre going?
e1jpg2,f8ppgsz,Like how you‚Äôre thinking out loud. ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
e1jpg2,f8pzkhj,Lol
e1jpg2,f8qk1cg,Wouldn‚Äôt having both systems working together be better than one or the other?
e1jpg2,f8qn344,https://i.imgur.com/p4VJHkd.png
e1jpg2,f8uxrma,"I had this same thought.   It looks just like stealth tech.    Though I'm sure it's not the reason Tesla chose this design, but I'm sure they have had a good laugh about it !"
e1jpg2,f8rd9tc,I'm with you.  That makes sense but I guess the systems work against each other more often and that makes the effort costly.  Tesla thinks that cameras can do everything lidar does and then some.  And that humans are capable of driving fine with just eye sight alone.  I'm guessing there'll be a time when all sensors can work harmoniously with each other but that's also probably when the singularity occurs.  Hail our Tesla AI OVERLORDS.
e1jpg2,f8reub9,"True, there are occasions where it‚Äôd be great for some things to augment driver vision, though.  

The one that jumps out at me, as I ride a motorbike too, is motorbikes and other smaller objects. Motorbikes are smaller, so our quick response is to assume they‚Äôre further away, and that they aren‚Äôt approaching as quickly as they appear. Lidar could make a quick track of that.  

Another thing (not lidar) would be situational awareness based on geography. Like how there‚Äôs a hazard perception test in the UK, we‚Äôre trained to expect certain unpredictable events in certain areas, so if the system can use data based on the type of area the car is in, it could adjust where it is prioritizing and it‚Äôs reaction.  

What sucks is that I definitely feel different after riding my bike to driving my car. I am mentally drained after riding because I am scanning and adjusting my immediate plans and escape routes as I ride, but my (I guess in computer terms) sample rate in a car is much lower, because the consequences of a right of way violation in my car aren‚Äôt as dire as they are on a motorbike. Hopefully we‚Äôll get to a point where autopilot, FSD and driver safety aids get so good that if you want to drive an unassisted car, you need to take advanced training to qualify for the license.  

Although, that drained feeling from riding isn‚Äôt all that negative, because the ride is so engaging and enjoyable even with the extra brainpower being used."
fxye2h,fmxef8h,"Technically, Tesla is right. Cars that are discounted like that are sold ""as-is"" (cosmetic wise, the rest of the warranty still applies). Their customer service leaves a LOT to be desired, I'm with you on that.

As far as the seat glue separating, I think you may still have a shot at getting that fixed if it looks as bad as it sounds. The paint ""oreo"" is from someone wet sanding the paint badly. Any reputable detailer should be able to fix that. You could even do it yourself with some compound and polish. There's very little chance that Tesla will fix that. Same with the damaged rim.

As far as an ""as-is"" new car, it's not really as-is. it's just the cosmetic condition that's as-is. If anything is actually broken that's a warranty item, they do still have to fix it. Again, I 100% agree with you that they need to disclose this and make it VERY clear to their customers. ""Clear"" doesn't seem to be in Tesla's vocabulary in general."
fxye2h,fmxgewt,"TL; DR'd, either it comes with a new car warranty or it doesn't."
fxye2h,fmxgdxc,"The damaged rim actually was replaced in full a few days after I picked up the vehicle, and the service center invoice listed it as a ""Remediation"".

So, I'm happy for that at least.  TBH, I've never had such a strange and strained communication with any of my previous buying experiences.  I do get the fact that they're not seasoned with a century worth of sales experience and it's a novel approach to selling a vehicle, but yeah, it really makes me feel like I'm nothing more than a nuisance to them rather than a valued customer.
From the outside looking in, I feel like it shouldn't have been too difficult to have poached the best of the best in ICE sales executives who would have been able to put together a more streamlined and responsive sales model.

I don't think it shouldn't be too much to ask that the operations manager doesn't act like he's having to pay for the repairs out of his own pocket."
fxye2h,fmxhetx,"Yeah, that's my take too, and the warranty is so sparsely defined it both good and bad.  Good that you can seemingly argue anything and bad because it takes a lot of time and effort to do so."
fxye2h,fmxhgwk,"Honestly I don't think they care. People keep buying Teslas with their shitty service (myself included) so they really don't have much of an incentive to change. Even today, they don't have any real competition in the 35-70k range. I agree that they need to change, but this is just my explanation on why their service sucks."
sw07sf,hxjawxh,"When I purchased my Tesla (2019 S100D) I got unlimited supercharging. For some reason it was never activated on my account and I didn't realize for a few months until I saw my supercharger credits going down.

I contacted Tesla through their online support form and they ultimately directed me to my sales advisor who was able to get it squared away for me and had the unlimited supercharging re-added to my account."

Your math is right $22500 at $7500 each). I prepare and supervise, construction cones, an oncoming. 18 wheeler when making a left, weird traffic lights, bad weather, wacky traffic patterns (is that an actual thing ‚Äúwacky). Emergency services.  So. Conveniences may be not all we want but it pulls you back into the lane, it supports you during bright light, low light, it helps park, and get out of parking spots.

But they make it seem flawless (if supervised). Hey. That does sound like me after all."
1d2k1eu,l67ugqj,"Definitely use the accelerator on almost every stop sign and take over on roundabouts. My philosophy is: I am a supervisor, not a tester, meaning if I already know that there are circumstances that FSD doesn‚Äôt perform 100% I just take over beforehand, like in roundabouts. Then I take a second chance after the next upgrade to see if it improves. But it is clear that it has made huge progress in the last few months, in spite of making serious mistakes."

v382sk,iax28i2,"I agree. My wife can't handle when I turn FSD on when she is in the car. She freaks out when it makes some bad moves... and boy does it make bad moves in my area where road markings are faded or non existant.

The FSD beta team need to make FSD Beta handle bad road marking way better. At the moment when some of the marking disappear it will throw itself right or left like a drunk driver. Elon said FSD should be able to drive without any road markings... clearly not the case. Human naturally do this after driving a few times on the same road. So we instinctively know that there are two lanes and a bicycle lane beside them and can drive accordingly even if there is no clear marking. To be as good as humans FSD WILL need to emulate this or else will always feel like a bad driver in such conditions.

One would expect FSD to rely on pre mapped road knowledge from all the other FSD cars accumulating perfect maps over time... but no... not doing that for sure.

Sometimes it will accelerate madly and brake at the last second instead of averaging things out like a human would do.

Lots of improvement before we can have an enjoyable and relaxing robotaxi experience. At the moment, in the area where I drive, it feels more like a new driver on the 2nd day driving a car.

This is under 10.12.2 by the way."
v382sk,iaxa9cn,"I used to use the State Farm app on my Ford Fusion hybrid. When I got my model 3 I was excited to see what kind of savings using this app would have. 

I found that the State Farm app has no concept of regenerative braking and would call normal regen braking ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù. 

This ended up in a $5 savings over 6 months. I talked with my agent about the regen braking part, but they were not interested in pushing for a change, so I decided to quit using the app and letting them track my drives. 

I understand the acceleration part and that is all on me ( I enjoy my model 3 performance‚Äôs quick acceleration to the speed limit).

https://gmauthority.com/blog/2022/05/gm-cruise-av-blocks-fire-truck-responding-to-an-emergency/  
According to WIRED, the San Francisco Fire Department was attempting to respond to an emergency at around 4 a.m. when it happened upon a double-parked garbage truck. The fire truck attempted to go into the oncoming lane to pass the garbage truck when it happened a driverless Chevy Bolt EV that was sitting stationary in the lane. While a human driver would have had the wherewithal to clear the lane for the emergency vehicle, the autonomous vehicle allegedly stayed put, blocking the firetruck until the garbage truck driver ran out from their workplace to move their vehicle.

v382sk,iaygaix,I‚Äôm in the same boat. The ‚Äúdrive safe‚Äù program is still cheaper than anything that I‚Äôve found but it really doesn‚Äôt like FSD.
v382sk,iaz4zt3,LOL yea I have the same app and it is destroying my State Farm discount.
v382sk,iaxe7ur,"I have the State Farm app and I tend to get dinged when using FSD more than when I drive, when I drive my hits are usually for speeding (higher than +7 over) and rarely for turning too fast.  FSD never speeds, I set it at +3 over by default and at most bump it to +6. Sadly map data is so overall shit that many roads near me are defaulting to 25mph   
   
  
The SF App is highly sensitive to hard left and right turns at intersections but I have never had FSD trip one of these. If anything FSD makes right and left intersection turns quite slowly.   
    
As for acceleration warnings, even on the newest the acceleration is uneven. Meaning it seems to start off slow then suddenly realize that it needs to get to the set speed and over compensates.     
    
Braking however it the biggest issue. While the new FSD beta does real good in showing a distant stopped car it does not do the same for lights. It can slow down quite quickly even for lights that were already red. I know its using the physical brakes.  
  
Yet I have not hit a score as low as the OP has. Please note I get a two week score, I don't see scores for individual drives.  I see Acceleration, Braking, Cornering, Speeding, and Phone Distraction, events scored in 1-5 with 5 being best; they don't ding you for the phone use because they cannot guarantee it is the driver on the phone.   
  
As for why I use it?  Drops my rates about thirty per month."
v382sk,iaxggpk,"Anecdotally this was my experience. I did very well on everything except braking. When I asked the insurance company why I was docked on braking they said I went from accelerating to breaking too quickly instead of coasting before braking.

Everyone here has every right to be critical of FSD, people here have collectively dropped millions towards a software package that 1. isn't in wide release, and 2. isn't ready for prime time even in the limited beta testing.

Nearly everyone here, if not everyone, has had FSD/AP/EAP/or whatever act up in odd, inconsistent, or dangerous ways that create hazards for themselves or other drivers.  A car driving on roads where 99.9999999% of drivers are human should drive like a human and be predictable and consistent.  That's the metric it should be measured against, the best human drivers.  Who are consistent and confident in their actions, they've been doing this a lot longer than any AI.

Secondly, all of these apps and metrics are bullshit to a degree.  With Tesla, in my opinion, being the worst offender simply due to how many things trigger erroneous collision warnings and 'unsafe' driving.

I don‚Äôt know how they define it, but PREDICTABLE and CONSISTENT behaviors are the most important factors for safe driving and keeping other vehicles around you safe. Behaving inconsistently with human driving behavior while around other human drivers is less safe. If I see a car acting unusual around me, I will absolutely pass them or stay behind them because I am nervous that they are not paying attention, and having a Tesla veering across a merge lane instead of hugging the inner lane markers does not inspire confidence.

As a human I can only drive anywhere near my best in areas where I have a great deal of experience.  Both from a drive policy position (how drivers behave locally) and from a mapping perspective.

""There is a bike lane that starts over the crest of this hill and you need to move to the left to anticipate it.""

It's a bit unrealistic IMO to expect FSD to somehow intuit that there's going to have prescient knowledge like that for everywhere on earth.  There are plenty of intersections that I would also have a moment of internal panic as well if I hadn't drive them 100 times and feel 100% confident in ""yes, it's legal to pass through this intersection and take a weird little spur off to the right in this 5 way intersection.  That is in fact my lane because the road there is a one-way, otherwise it would be illegal because that would be an opposite direction lane."""
v382sk,iay3iko,"In addition to the huge storage requirements, that would also have the disadvantage of being almost always out of date when there are road construction projects, temporary closures, and detours going on.

v382sk,ib5b5sb,"It‚Äôs really not about that. And for many years I‚Äôve been beta testing Tesla software as part of both the FSD beta and the Early Access Program before that.

There has been improvement in the decision making, slowly but clearly. What hasn‚Äôt improved is the jerky, spastic, exaggerated driving characteristics of the AI. 

Human driving education focuses first on good driving mechanics. Accelerate, steer, and brake in a controlled and careful manner while learning the basic driving laws and safe habits (e.g. get into the right lane for your turn well in advance of the turn.) 

*Then* drive and improve your response to different driving scenarios through real world experience.

The car needs to mimic human driving until all the cars are AI. Until then it is dangerous and foolish to improve driving logic without driving mechanics. 

What‚Äôs more, if you have an army of human beta testers, why wait to give them a predictable driving experience? Why not limit distractions to permit full attention on driving decisions? Why the noise? Why expect the beta testers and their families to have to learn to dull their response to alarming behavior in hopes the car makes the right call as well as how to intervene at the last minute because that hope was unrealized?

I posted this because I think it‚Äôs reasonable to at least be doing both equally and the experience piece has improved very little IMO. I think if it improved then many more miles would be captured, benefiting the cause of autonomy and sustainable transport. It would at least feel like our student driver is driving the car rather than an enraged child with an uncontrolled seizure disorder. I know at least for me I could double my recorded miles if the car didn‚Äôt freak out my friends, family, and community every time we try FSD."

>I always feather my deceleration for driver and passenger comfort

That's 100% fine, I'm just providing additional information here to point out that the car's regen IS strong enough to trigger an infraction on the USAA app. If you always feather your deceleration then YOU can't really say whether it is capable of penalizing regenerative braking.

Like if somebody asked whether their model 3 is capable of accelerating fast enough to trigger an infraction on their car insurance app (granted USAA specifically doesn't do infractions for acceleration), I wouldn't say ""no, the car's acceleration won't trigger an infraction"" if the truth was ""well, I never put the pedal down all the way anyway, I feather it to drive safely - so it doesn't happen to me"".

And yes, in your last reply you did qualify it by saying ""in my experience"", but in the original comment I replied to, you did not.

Battery state of charge and temperature, and settings can also contribute to regen strength - I was just pointing out that USAA's algorithm isn't loose enough to allow any/all regen braking."
v382sk,iaxsfdr,There it is.

raatcy,hnhjezl,"I got 10.6 yesterday morning. I started with 10.3 a month+ ago (2017 S75D).

I had my first 0 disengagement drive home from work finally last night! There are a bunch of weird intersections and non-painted or badly painted lines so it still has some issues but it took me the whole way home last night yay! :) It did not take me 100% to work though. I do have to nudge the accelerator at some intersections etc."
raatcy,hni7a6e,"10.6 definitely feels more of a natural driving style than 10.5. Very happy with the improvements, long way to go for real FSD but it's getting better."
raatcy,hni8oqp,I still haven‚Äôt gotten 10.6 :/ wondering if they stopped rolling it out
raatcy,hnhmb7x,"I‚Äôm new to the FSD beta family as I‚Äôve been included for less than a week.  Maybe I‚Äôm not confident in the system enough but it‚Äôs not very good in my environment (northern NJ suburbs) on small roads.  When you get to larger roads it‚Äôs ok but the smaller roads are a problem.  

Biggest issues I‚Äôve seen
- racing to a left hand turn then breaking hard
- long delays before making a turn on turns with no yield or stop signs with no other cars in sight.
- issues seeing left turn lanes only.  causes the car to bounce between lanes 

The system has made great jumps from the videos I‚Äôve been watching for about a year.  I do think it needs another year before the driver could pay attention but not be on high alert at all times."
raatcy,hnheicw,"4.a - Great! 4.b - Not so great...

But this sounds like some great progress!"
raatcy,hnhl6mm,10.5 was my first build of FSD beta. I haven‚Äôt received notice of 10.6 available. Is it a batches rollout? Anyone know a typical wait time? My car took forever to receive its first OTA updates after purchase.
raatcy,hnitlum,"10.5 still can't read speed limit signs so when driving through private developments with posted speed limit signs that don't match general city speed limits it ignores them.  For example in the town of University park, FL, the posted speeds are 24mph, 19mph and 14mph, the Tesla selects 25mph and goes zipping around ignoring the speed limits that are strictly enforced."
raatcy,hnkg5nu,96-98 safety score here and still don‚Äôt have access üò≠

raatcy,hniqm3m,"Sounds promising, especially #1 and also #3 further improving phantom braking.  

I felt like the car was trying to kill me with 10.4. 
10.5 had some improvements but still too indecisive and jerky for my taste. 

Maybe I'll get to try out 10.6 before I let my FSD subscription expire in about three weeks."
raatcy,hniqwmg,Wouldn‚Äôt know still haven‚Äôt got hit like 75% of Beta testers. They are super slow rolling this one along with hammering 40.6 for general.

raatcy,hnjapuy,Does anyone have any version of the beta in Idaho? I am at 99SS and havent gotten anything.. hoping to get it while In California visiting family
raatcy,hnju1at,"Number 2 is the most exciting for me. I have a right turn I make nearly every day with one of those painted dividing areas then a bike lane. 50% FSD tries to pull into the bike lane, 30% it wiggles the steering wheel and almost stops trying to decide which ""lane"" it wants, and 20% it gets it right with minimal hesitation. I've flagged those failed turns multiple times, so hopefully the new build can do it.

Now to teach it how to do left turns [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xL9HX8X3QDdSH2mQ7). Two layers of lights -- the first crosses the left turn lane to the other side of oncoming traffic, while the second protects you from cross-traffic. FSD drives right past the entrance to the left-turn lane, then can't figure out why it can't turn left."
raatcy,hni61rq,So you had a zero disengagement drive with interventions (the go pedal).
raatcy,hni5e9q,Yeah the nudging is ok with me...I'd rather it be a bit more cautious yet than pretending to confidently send it.
raatcy,hni3i5u,Did you have to get a camera upgrade for your 75D? I‚Äôm about to be in range of approval but I also have one and not sure if I‚Äôll be good.
raatcy,hnigywt,Tonight should be the big push.
raatcy,hnhnry8,"You should see it improve in your area after a couple builds. 10.3 was awful in my town when I first got it, but in the past month my car has uploaded 471GB of data and it has gotten significantly better."
raatcy,hniioth,"I did find that there was certainly an alignment period for me where it just did things slightly different than I would have so I‚Äôd disengage often. Over time, we bonded and now I know more when it‚Äôs going to be wrong versus different. Disengagements dropped a lot just from that. 

It‚Äôs still not anything to be used outside of serious testers but I‚Äôve noticed feedback tends to level out a bit as the system is more understood."
raatcy,hnhljq6,Same.  Wondering if they are finding some minor issues they want to correct with a subversion change
raatcy,hnivsvd,"Same here, about to ask the same question."
raatcy,hnj06d8,"First off, WTF with those speed limits?  üòÄ

I have a use case where I've been able to prove it does indeed read speed limit signs (I was skeptical before this).

I have a road where the speed limit is 40mph.  There is this one section where they put up a 25mph sign due to construction (that's long finished).

The car will always slow down and indicate the speed limit is 25mph at this sign.

The other day, that sign was occluded by a Bus....the car kept the speed at 40mph.

So at least in this case it is reading the sign.  Which blew my mind, because I have another instance where there is *no* sign and it will slow to 25mph for about half a block, then back up to 30mph.  Even though there isn't a speed limit sign posted.  This points to bad map data."
raatcy,hnjrlp5,Same here
raatcy,hnpqa9d,"I‚Äôm sorry, but they probably need a few people on each recent version lol‚Ä¶ ;)"
raatcy,hni56tm,"Today I just left the house to run an errand...probably 20 minutes of total driving time.  I think I really only had 1 ""real"" intervention where I disengaged with the stalk and said ""WRONG"" out loud to the car when it was trying to do the left across a 6 lane road where the double left is new and not marked yet.

The other two were me pushing the accelerator to nudge it since there was traffic behind me."
raatcy,hni5l6h,It might be worth it to reset your score(if that‚Äôs still doable) because I doubt they will get to 96.
raatcy,hnijhbg,Good point I did use the wrong wording. Corrected.
raatcy,hni3y5n,No it was a late 2017 with ap2.5. I have had the MCU2/fsd computer upgrades though.

raatcy,hnhy3mh,FSD beta has not substantively changed in my area since 10.2
raatcy,hnivn5h,How do you see how much data your car has reported?
raatcy,hnhqbww,"If you watch teslafi or teslascope you can see the waves being rolled out. So far on both sites only ~2.5% of logged cars from 10.5 build have been moved to 10.6. I would suspect if no issues were found on the first wave then a larger second wave will go out most likely 6pm PST, at least that's what I've seen on my car taking 10.4, and 10.5.."
raatcy,hnj1gpy,"The car showed 25mph but that is not what the speed limit signs said.  University Park is an incorporated town with their own police force and with radar enforcement.  The limits are weird but hey, it's their town and they set the limits.  I just don't want a ticket because my Tesla decided the signs were wrong or it can't read them."
raatcy,hni5i53,That‚Äôs how you report things? By saying wrong?
raatcy,hnjgt5f,"Yeah sadly their system has no leeway. You either have a 100 (A), 99 (C-) or 0-98 (F), so the only way to pass is to ""cheat""."

e2t2tk,f8xkw7h,Well this is interesting. Just checked my phone and it said a software update was available a few hours ago. Went into the Tesla app and there's no sign of an update.
e2t2tk,f8xnoj9,How do you actually report a bug with voice? How much detail are you giving to try and explain a bug? I want to do it if it is actually looked at and potentially helpful

After triggering the update then the app says ‚ÄúSoftware update‚Äù ‚ÄúScheduled for Wed 8:40PM‚Äù which is in the past today about when I triggered it. However, when I actually click the update and ‚Äúinstall now‚Äù then the apps says ‚ÄúNo software update is available‚Äù. WTF.

e2t2tk,f8yikmu,">I recently had a Tesla ""Remote"" tech do some maintenance, and he mentioned he remotely looks at a lot of Autopilot bug reports. He confirmed that the bug reports via voice do get remotely looked at.
He did recommend trying to verbalize such that the text-to-speech looks correct. Otherwise they just throw it in the trash.

This might bridge the confusion about whether bug reports get uploaded or not. u/greentheonly had said that they're saved locally, not uploaded, but that techs can access them if needed. Others have insisted (with less evidence) that they are uploaded and reviewed. 

If it only sends the speech-to-text for the remote techs to decide whether it's interesting, and they queue them for later upload if they decide it is, that might more fully explain the process."
e2t2tk,f8xfxu2,Any update?
e2t2tk,f8xgjct,"Update: 2nd reboot, 80%

They also have no financial stake in you deciding to take or keep the car. Just do the right thing. You'll be more likely to self-hate in the future if you don't turn it away if it has issues, than if you take it. As someone who has been screwed by Tesla several times, I can assure you you're better off dealing with it then and there."
icpntl,g248gel,[deleted]
icpntl,g240ph6,Bring along a friend who can/will speak up for you?
icpntl,g242n17,"The bring a friend for support is a great suggestion, if that‚Äôs a possibility. Regardless if you‚Äôre shy, an extra set of eyes will help identify things you may miss. 
Also, keep in mind, you would be just delaying your delivery, not completely canceling it. 
Be polite, point the issues that are wrong and making you decide to refuse.  Take pics and/or video. 

By the way, as someone who will be taking delivery next week, I completely understand your anxiety. I‚Äôve been feeling some of that after reading all the horror stories. To the point of considering to stop reading comments here. 
Remain optimistic that your experience will be a good one, as it has been for many others."
icpntl,g244iww,"Maybe have a think ahead of time what would make you refuse the vehicle. For me that would be significant panel misalignment, dents or damage to the paintwork. Basically I wouldn't accept a car that needs to go to a body shop for more than a day. 

That way when you arrive you already know what would make you refuse the car and what you would accept. If the car meets your criteria for refusal then politely say you had already decided ahead of time that you wouldn't take a car with X thing wrong with it and you are refusing delivery. Take someone else with you for moral support.

I would accept anything that can be fixed by swapping out a whole part e.g. wheel damage, ripped seat, etc. because you know that they can get the car back to a pristine condition. That's not always the case with bodywork or misalignment."
icpntl,g2534sq,"If you do find anything, point it out, then make sure that you get the ‚ÄúDue List‚Äù before you sign the acceptance. 
I had a minor dent in the bumper, pointed it out, they called in someone from service to take a look, took pics and said they would fix it. - couple other minor things as well (chipped rear view mirror)

BUT we got in a hurry (impatient 3 year old was with us) and I did not get the ‚ÄúDue List‚Äù in writing. 

I eventually talked mobile service to fixing everything under warranty a few months later but it was not easy...

So get that in writing and then you have the leverage to work against."
icpntl,g25lcn7,Bring a friend.
icpntl,g243lpj,"Its your money. If you find it acceptable great. Take it and dont complain.

Otherwise take heed from all the horror stories of Tesla not fixing their mistakes. I have one as well. We are now on the 8th month and no results as yet. 

DO NOT ACCEPT IT IF YOU DONT LIKE IT. YOU MAY NEVER GET IT REPAIRED NO MATTER WHAT THEY TELL YOU."
icpntl,g254soe,"I was shy. Then I realized that I'm probably not gonna run into the other party anytime soon. Even if I did, odds are both of us won't even remember each other. So what is the point of being shy then? It is your loss at the end of the day. Just carry the same attitude when you pick it up.

It's good to be prepared but don't let it give you anxiety."
icpntl,g246tnw,Food is a totally separate issue generally these cost you between $15-30. You're buying a car and spending over $40k If you complain about the quality of your car it's not like someone's going to spit in your car and give it back to you unlike being worried about complaining about a meal and them doing something to your food because you complain.
icpntl,g24mgsu,"I bought a relatively early Model 3 and went in with a long checklist of things to look for and the car was perfect. Reports on the internet tend to be skewed towards those who had a bad experience, so chances are it will be fine.

But should the car be unacceptable say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but this car is unacceptable so I‚Äôm going to have to refuse delivery.‚Äù Now practice saying that aloud a few times. I know it sounds silly, but saying out loud a few times, not in your head, will make it much easier to say in the moment. Also, the suggestion to bring a not-shy friend along is a good one.

Good luck and congrats on your new Tesla!"

icpntl,g25jf3k,"as others have suggested, bring someone along is one good way of helping handling the interaction.

alternately, i've found discussing the topic in an exploratory/questioning way first helps ease into it. for example, asking the person a hypothetical about if there's quality issues you aren't comfortable with and you want to decline delivery, what happens then? this prompts the OTHER person to talk through rejecting delivery. after that it's easier because it's an option that's been offered to you - you can say 'actually i think that's what i'd like to do, decline this delivery and wait for another to come in'. there might be a bit more back and forth but at that point just stick to saying you'd like to take the option to decline."

I picked up my Y on Friday 8/14 from the Portland OR service center and I only found a few very minor issues that I have a mobile service appointment for on Friday. I went through the Model Y delivery checklist from top to bottom and what I found was the driver door handle had a small chip in the black coating, the passenger front interior piece that has the window switch has a cut from what looks like a utility knife, I have a vibration which seems like it's coming from the passenger window at certain speeds when driving, and when my AC is on full blast there is a odd noise that doesn't happen in my Model 3.

I scheduled my service appointment on 8/14 when I got home and noticed these issues, I got an email saying the parts had been ordered and a notification to approve the cost estimate in my app which was $0 as everything was covered.

Delivery day, focus on #1 mainly. These are the big ones because #2 items you can bring up after the day under warranty.

If you find problems with #1 then I suggest you discuss them with your delivery expert in this order:

1. Can we get this fixed today (suggest you ask for earliest appointment possible in the day and take the day off if you can)? If you are receiving your car at a factory or service center, they have people there to handle these problems. 
2. If cannot get fixed today, do not accept ""Schedule maintenance later"". Instead ask for a ""due bill"" on your car. It is effectively the same thing, but you have OFFICIAL record that the problem was found on delivery and not later.
3. IF they refuse a due bill, that's when my alarms would go off. At this point, just tell yourself they are INTENTIONALLY trying to get away with giving you a subpar car. You gave them 3 chances (being good, fix today, due bill) to take care of you. You don't owe them any more at this point.

One thing to remember is that once you refuse delivery, you cannot receive the same configuration again (unless something has changed recently). So make sure if you are refusing, you really mean it."

Even more so now people know they are known for these issues. How long does it really take to walk round a car and check these things. If someone has been waiting 8 weeks for delivery, does one more day really matter if the difference is no defects vs bad perceptions and hassle for the new owner?"

v7cws0,ibkrh80,Would recommend using the chill version of beta and keep control of the cars speed. Find a nice chill route and learn it thoroughly as a control point. Be ready to disengage with brake pedal at all times. Just turning the steering wheel will not disengage TACC.
v7cws0,ibkl7cj,I would advise you to keep your camera surfaces clean :-).
v7cws0,ibv3w9i,My first drive was awesome. Now it is insanely temperamental. It is braking super hard at every green light now. Making me super frustrated.
v7cws0,ibkjp9f,I don‚Äôt like the speed limit sign reader or whatever it‚Äôs called.  You can be going 65mph in a 55 zone and then it‚Äôs sees a 55 sign and slows you down to 55. Annoying.
v7cws0,ibm5e0w,"As a pleb AP user for 5 years having just received FSD Beta yesterday, I would say that I'd love to have the option to tone it down.

I remember reading other reports about 10.2 and sort of jackrabbit starts and turns, with some folks really preferring it, but I think I'd have more faith (especially as a new user) in allowing it to perform if it just slowed the fuck down. This morning while making a right turn at a wide intersection, it just seemed to be taking the turn way faster than I wanted it to, did a little hesitation in the middle of the turn, so I felt like I had to intervene due to the speed. If it just dialed it back a bit, I would've been fine giving it some more leeway to perform, as I know I'd be able to intervene more easily.

I also am getting the impression that the following distance setting on our old 2017 S does not seem to result in much of a difference on FSD Beta on the street. Again, comparing to old AP, FSD Beta seems to prefer being MUCH closer to the car in-front, which I as a human driver do not prefer from a reaction-time and visibility standpoint. (The assholes who tailgate all the time apparently feel differently, so maybe they can high-five FSD Beta over that.)

Above all, I'm incredibly pleased to FINALLY have the ability to directly experience it. Seeing how good perception has become compared to car control and basic mapping lacking gives me faith this process will eventually work. 

To me, perception is the hard part while car control and mapping ""should"" be easy to improve, though curiously seems to still be faceplanting on items that feel like they could be fixed with 1.0 style code."
v7cws0,ibo4v1q,"Completely agree! It is extremely assertive, I had to put my settings to chill mode and even like that it goes way too fast after making turns. I am also surprised they opened it with this version because it‚Äôs not been good for me at all."
v7cws0,ic4k2r5,i wish i was back on 10.11 üôÉ
v7cws0,iblt6g7,"For me it made my auto highbeams worse, and the driving didn‚Äôt change other than now it thinks pylons are in the middle of the road instead of off to the side.

It also took me a few hours to recalibrate as it‚Äôs based on distance, not time."
v7cws0,ibkr6fo,FSD Beta is Beta
v7cws0,ibnoavs,How do you take an autopilot snapshot? Is this hold the car button?
v7cws0,ibl81ul,You can change that in the settings.
v7cws0,ibon68o,"I'm of the opinion that the Chill/Average/Assertive FSD buttons don't do anything at all.

They were put there to potentially do something (like rolling stops before those were taken away) but never implemented.

Sort of like Standard/Advanced on software updates."
v7cws0,ibm29tt,"Cameras are constantly calibrating, there is rarely a reason to reset them.

Calibration also happens only when there are lanes on either side of your own lane."
v7cws0,ibm3gy4,Did you follow the points made in the linked thread? For me the first time took for ever as well. Following the method in the manual completed in minutes.
v7cws0,ibnwz1r,"Small icon at the top that looks like a movie camera just to the right of the temperature.

v7cws0,ible77j,Sorry for the dumb question but which setting is that?
v7cws0,iblr5ba,Does it change for regular non fsd autopilot?
v7cws0,ibm307u,how?  TIA
v7cws0,ibo272v,Thank you
v7cws0,ibls6wq,"Yeh, it changes the TACC, autopilot, and FSD reaction to speed limit changes."
v7cws0,ibls7bw,"Yeh, it changes the TACC, autopilot, and FSD reaction to speed limit changes."
xj6mos,ip6m83j,"Chill.  I‚Äôve been doing this a while now, and it always seems a bit more jerky on Assertive.  If you feel Chill is a bit too slow or cautious you can always gently nudge it along with the accelerator.  With assertive, it may feel jarring in its acceleration and turns at times and you‚Äôll be hovering over the brakes.  Better to nudge along then to have o shit moments necessitating the brakes.  You can always go up to average and assertive later"
xj6mos,ip6mar8,Start out with chill mode until you learn how your car behaves so you don't disengage/take over for no reason because it can be unsettling at first.
xj6mos,ip6nwkc,Chill but I honestly wish for a drone mode where it wouldn‚Äôt change lanes for almost no reason and just cruise until I gave it input
xj6mos,ip6uzx0,Chill for me personally. But I'm also a chill mode driver myself on the acceleration.
xj6mos,ip71vd4,"I haven't see clear difference between each. Can't say one is ""better"" than others"
xj6mos,ip71yyo,"I'm of the belief that these don't do anything anymore.

If they ever did.

I'm on assertive, and even when there is a car going 15mph slower than the speed limit, and the lane to my left is open, the car still won't pass.

Possibly when rolling stops were allowed this setting had an effect (though I couldn't tell), but I just don't see any difference.

Would love to see some tests done, but it's so hard without a controlled environment (same cars at the same point etc.)."
xj6mos,ip87xm8,"Even chill is too aggressive on lane changes. For example, I need to make a left in 0.3 miles. The car ahead of me is doing the speed limit. It'll change to the far right lane for no apparent reason. I have to disable fsd cuz it's terrible."
xj6mos,ip6n38x,"Chill.   You're not in control, so assertive can be terrifying."
xj6mos,ip7r6ee,I switched to chill after getting annoyed by FSD changing lanes back and forth for no reason.
xj6mos,ip6lwpc,"I guess that would be more of your preference, I'm starting with Chill right now cause I want to have more space between the front car in the event they brake or they head into traffic, I don't get sudden hard brakes."
xj6mos,ip6u1ki,Assertive and then don‚Äôt trust it for a second.
xj6mos,ip7ny13,They hardly change anything anyway
xj6mos,ip6me6a,"From 10.2 to around 10.12.2 I was on ""Average"", however, starting with 10.12.2 I've started using ""Assertive"", and that one seems to be more in line with my driving style, and it's been managing itself just fine.

If you're new to the beta I'd start using ""Average"" for now, and then shift it up, or down, as you see fit once you get used to the behaviors."
xj6mos,ip6ug8i,When did you send out the request for FSD Beta? Do they still enroll people in the program? I want to subscribe and then enroll to FSD Beta but I don't know how long would it take.
xj6mos,ip7f1pv,Give them all a try.
xj6mos,ip85s11,[deleted]
xj6mos,ip8ezct,since I live in the city where everyone drives aggressive. Assertive has worked for me. I guess it all depends on the situation. I feel like Chill and Average can sometimes take it‚Äôs time making decisions. I would start with those modes until you feel comfortable
xj6mos,ip8p8qd,"Balls to the walls, baby!"
xj6mos,ip8qtg6,"Try all three and see which you like. I personally jump around version to version since the behavior changes between versions. 

Right now I‚Äôm either running chill or average."
xj6mos,ip8wawp,"The chill setting is not chill enough for me. It still follows the lead car too closely, and it still does too many speed-based lane changes. To make matters worse, it's too chill when it comes to merging into the lane necessary to continue the route. For this reason, I ended up changing it to aggressive, but IMO, I think these three buttons are just a placebo because I don't really see a huge difference between them, and it's difficult to put the car in the exact same situations to see the differences. Again, it's not chill enough in the areas that it's supposed to be, so it's really not worth it if these buttons actually do anything."
xj6mos,ip8x4ky,BMW-mode. 25% longer range due to a follow distance of 0 (reduces drag) and no use of blinkers.
xj6mos,ip90ooe,"More importantly, the chill acceleration setting is what helps me have fewer disengagements. The car accelerates and decelerates more smoothly, so the decisions the car makes are less jarring. The FSD profile I use, is average. So, these are 2 different settings that you need to play around with to find your comfort zone."
xj6mos,ip98ce2,"I can‚Äôt tell the difference between any of them. Chill is very aggressive, and assertive is very slow at times."
xj6mos,ip9g3rh,"At times when Chill its still Assertive lol.  Traffic is stop up ahead with cars braking, why the hell is it speeding up to brake hard. SMH."
xj6mos,ip9mb49,"I'm on assertive to keep up with chicago traffic,  it is still not assertive enough to merge in rush hour"
xj6mos,ip9vn47,Assertive! Live on the edge!
xj6mos,ipa3a1g,Me 2! Tried to kill my family today on my first try by creeping forward onto railroad tracks. What a time to be alive.
xj6mos,ipalod9,I got it today too. Really fun ripping some unprotected lefts this afternoon.
xj6mos,ipamln1,I use assertive and it is still timid much too much of the time.
xj6mos,ip6rdpa,Mad Max isn't an option anymore?
xj6mos,ip791hy,How did you get the beta?
xj6mos,ip7ebid,"What‚Äôs the minimum safety score right now, 98?"
xj6mos,ip8l9cj,You just got FSD too?! Idk how I got it this morning as well. My score is only 96. I thought I was getting the new update. And it only showed me updates on FSD. I was like this was pointless to update. Come to find I have FSD lol
xj6mos,ip8veg7,"Meanwhile, I‚Äôm sitting here with a 100 safety score and still no update. At least I‚Äôm on 2022.20.9 so there‚Äôs hope"
xj6mos,ip8xcyk,FSD‚Ä¶ mwuah ha ha ha! üí∏
xj6mos,ip91z8n,Lol Chill for me
xj6mos,ip9jnrn,[deleted]
xj6mos,ip9vav0,Is this available for only those that bought the fsd? Cuz I have fsd but I can‚Äôt use it üò¢
xj6mos,ipai4j1,Where is this setting? I have a 2017 Model 3 Long Range - can't recall seeing this before.
xj6mos,iqnla7f,What safety score did you have? Also how long after reaching the min safety score did you get fsd?
xj6mos,ip9i121,Not leaving the passing lane is just unacceptable.
xj6mos,ip6msqq,Thanks for the info!
xj6mos,ip6muhy,Thanks! Will do.
xj6mos,ip8uea6,Changing into the passing lane on two lane state highways and just sitting there is one of my biggest FSD pet peeves.
xj6mos,ip6vey9,[deleted]
xj6mos,ip75fkk,Thanks!
xj6mos,ip8i6fz,"Wow, I hope my experience is different where I live."
xj6mos,ip6ndwp,Happy Cake day! I guess I was just excited to get it but chill is probably the best way to start.
xj6mos,ip6no6n,Happy Cake Day!
xj6mos,ip76nkf,"You darn well are in control, that‚Äôs the whole point of the beta! If you‚Äôre not in control you are very much doing it wrong."

xj6mos,ip6rnbe,[deleted]
xj6mos,ip6maiv,"Definitely, but would like some feedback from people who have been using FSD for a little while now to gage what has worked best for them. I'm inclined to go assertive üôÇ"
xj6mos,ip6ymab,Thanks!
xj6mos,ip6mw9t,Thanks for the feedback!
xj6mos,ip6v9gv,They said they are releasing it to 150k people with safety scores over 80. I just got it this morning and was in the beta queue  for over a year at least.
xj6mos,ip6z0io,I did it a year ago I think when they first opened the request queue. My driving score has fluctuated from 80s to most recently in the low 90s. I got the DL notification at 3am est.
xj6mos,ip6vdok,I believe the plan is to start rolling out to folks with driver scores above 80 soon. So they are definitely still adding. I waited about 3 months after enrolling to get in.
xj6mos,ipaelhs,"My experience, more than 5000 milages with safety score 97"
xj6mos,ip7qbbh,I will start with chill and work my way up
xj6mos,ip8i2ct,"Lol, yeah, I haven't seen posts about this"
xj6mos,ip8ia9y,Thanks!
xj6mos,ip91foy,Thanks!
xj6mos,ip88odk,It is.  These are the FSD Beta/city street options.  Mad Max is under the Navigate on Autopilot settings for use on the highways.
xj6mos,ip7q8st,80 now but I had a 91
xj6mos,ip90jhu,"I just got it too, with a score of 85!"
xj6mos,ip8vkff,I bet you will get it in the next few days
xj6mos,ipa2coj,"No, I just got back from a trip and haven't really been driving. If they are counting since I got my Tesla then yes."
xj6mos,ipa28ka,It should be available to anyone with a score over 80 and of you opted in to the beta.
xj6mos,iqnlu49,I requested access as soon as it was available which was like a year ago if I remember correctly. My score has fluctuated from 80s to 90s most recently when I got the beta. I don't think I was at the minimum score until Elon said it would be opened to scores of 80s and above and then I got it like a week or two after he tweeted that.
xj6mos,ipamnzy,That‚Äôs not an FSD Beta setting. That‚Äôs an autopilot setting.  Different stack.
xj6mos,ip7sjm4,"I also recommend Chill. 

There's always trouble when your car starts getting ideas of its own."
xj6mos,ip7cm9i,"Assertive also really, REALLY likes to cut people off, and given previous versions cutting people off with only mere feet of clearance, i would say stick to Chill. I‚Äôve been using it for nearly a year in chill!"
xj6mos,ip9y5tz,I got an update recently - how did you ‚Äúactivate FSD‚Äù? I have been waiting and my score is in the 80s
xj6mos,ip9i9js,"Dafuq is avoiding the right lane lol. 

‚ÄúI choose not to travel in the travel lane.‚Äù -FSD sometimes and terrible drivers all the time"
xj6mos,ip9f9ew,"A lot of places have rules where the left lane is only for passing.

You'll get ticketed if you're just driving in it even with 0 cars around.

It's the rule here where I live in Canada, and I've been in a car pulled over for it on the way to Vegas in the US (we got off with a warning)

Edit: highways and freeways only.  No rules like that on city streets."
xj6mos,ip9ieek,This is wrong and arguably one of the biggest issues with training new drivers.
xj6mos,ip75gml,">Thanks!

You're welcome!"
xj6mos,ip8prog,"That was my initial reaction but I'm thinking they just meant that, if you don't take over, the car does what it wants."
xj6mos,ip803l7,Definitely start with Chill to learn the ropes of the system. We have it on Chill in both our cars in the Beta since late last year.
xj6mos,ip6r6yx,I haven't noticed much of a difference between them and I've used all 3 settings.
xj6mos,ip6x5u3,"I‚Äôve kept it on chill since I first got it a year ago. 

I don‚Äôt like the frequent lane changes to go around slower vehicles or backups. As a driver I tend to do that only when someone is just driving ridiculously slow. I prefer to get in the lane I need to instead of trying to jump into it late. 

Driver preference. In any setting, the car is going to change lanes with little warning (much faster than highway automatic lane changes) so you need to remain attentive."
xj6mos,ip7cuoq,"crazy to think it‚Äôs been a year, i‚Äôm still pretty certain most of us early testers got in by pretty easily exploiting the opt in system, but i also still believe that‚Äôs what they wanted."
xj6mos,ip6zgym,"Thank you. It seems if I subscribe to try it out, I will need to prepare to keep the subscription for few months to a year to get enrolled."
xj6mos,ip8onee,"Ah, gotcha."
xj6mos,ip8vrnm,I‚Äôm hoping. It‚Äôs been tough trying to keep a decent score while living in a hilly major city with tons of stop signs at the bottoms of said hills
xj6mos,ipahmn2,I'm a subscriber of FSD with scores in the high 90s and I don't have it either.
xj6mos,ipbe6c4,I was just reading the text in the pic‚Ä¶
xj6mos,ip8uhfj,"Agreed on Chill - up until 69.2 though, my car loved to jerk out in front of other cars like it owned the road. 

Coming up fast on my left, the F you are... 

I had to be extra careful and watch my side mirrors all the time in the city, especially when I knew a right turn was coming up because it would get over in the left lane at the drop of a hat in Chill. 69.2 has made it at least respect lanes and try to get into the correct lane about a mile from the turn, it's actually quite nice. I still pucker up though in traffic, expecting that random left lane shift..."
xj6mos,ipbjpci,"You go into Car>Autopilot and tap the slider for ""FSD Beta"".

Just keep in mind that the car might do some stupid shit, and you should be prepared to take over at any time."
xj6mos,ip9m3tl,What is the solution then? The NoA moves to right and 5 seconds later is back to the left lane because the right lane is slow. It does it again and again. I am not saying hug the left lane and do not allow the cars to pass. I am saying monitor the traffic behind you.
xj6mos,ip6s5dv,"Second this. Assertive would do rolling stops but since that was removed, I don't see much difference. Assertive is definitely not assertive around going through stop signs."
xj6mos,ip6yl0z,Interesting! Thanks.
xj6mos,ip75dco,"Yes, I would think so."
xj6mos,ip7fnv3,"Beta is expected to be widely released to all by the end of the year, so you‚Äôd get it within 3 months. Considering they‚Äôre now adding all scores >80, you‚Äôd be able to get in just by driving 100 miles and getting a score above that (also assuming your car is on version 2022.20.x and not something newer as they don‚Äôt do software downgrades). What software version is your car on?"
xj6mos,ipdepnh,Thank you so much! It worked! Gonna try it now
xj6mos,ip9msjh,"You merge into the left lane, you pass the car, and if you aren't about to pass another one in a very short time, you get out.  

You do it again and again and again.

You might not like it, but that's how it is in many places, and it's the law."
xj6mos,ip7h8x9,"I am on one of the latest 2022.28.2, and I haven't subscribed FSD yet.
It seems I would not be able to get FSD Beta with this build."
xj6mos,iqnmh4s,Congrats!
xj6mos,ip7hn4c,"That‚Äôs correct, you‚Äôd have to wait till the next FSD beta build which will hopefully be on the 2022.28.x branch. On the plus side Elon [just](https://i.imgur.com/L5xYgsO.jpg) confirmed that anyone who has a high enough safety score and >100 AP miles driven will get beta immediately. So, you hopefully won‚Äôt be waiting long at all."
13au775,jj80y3m,"Happens often, don't take it personally."
13au775,jj81d4x,Lol yeah it‚Äôs what evs but it was just from every now and again to almost monitoring my breathing lol
1c1eqh4,kz2prd9,"Not sure what the preferred nomenclature is on the subreddit but rejoice fellow model 3 refresh owners, we‚Äôve finally got FSD!!

1c1eqh4,kz4ns8y,Just tried FSD this morning and was actually pretty impressed!
1c1eqh4,kz9cial,"No offense intended to anyone. But I find the concept of self-driving vehicle extremely stressful. When you buy such a wonderful car, wouldn't you want to drive it and feel it respond to your touch. Teslas are so much fun to drive because they respond so well. So FSD will never be my thing. 

  
Also I know its just a me-thing. I find anyone chauffeuring me (when I am sitting in a car/cab) extremely stressful. When I am sitting in a car, I need to be the one driving it. Like after driving more than 400k miles over the last 20 yrs, I have been conditioned like that I guess. So cabs/ubers simply drive me nuts."
1c1eqh4,kz2tfwf,How long did you have to wait since delivery? I'm wondering if they are rolling it out in delivery order or something.
1c1eqh4,kz2ztno,I got it today as well. About 5 weeks after delivery.
1c1eqh4,kz37n2j,What software version does this model run? Highlands also do not have USS like the recent Model Y right? Does that mean we (Model Y no USS) are getting v12 soon?

1c1eqh4,kz8hp66,Did FSD just not exist on highland even if you paid for it or is this just for the free trial?
1c1eqh4,kz4oy2y,Been using it a bit through the day and it is fantastic! Spazzes out a lil on parking lots but not bad with everything else!
1c1eqh4,kzc4vtv,That is a completely reasonable opinion! I love driving the car without a doubt but fi also don‚Äôt like to drive either. When a drove to Miami yesterday it was the most stress free relaxed ‚Äúdrive‚Äù I‚Äôve had. Miami is a shithole to drive in so to have the Tesla do most of it was just brilliant.

1c1eqh4,kz3gah2,"MY without USS already has V12. I've been running it for about 3 weeks now (since the 30 day trial was released). If your car is very new, you may just need to wait a bit before the first update containing V12 is pushed to you."

1c1eqh4,kz8t1ry,"Correct, if you paid for FSD you only got access to the auto lane change with auto steer as well as autopark. Otherwise that was it. All highlands worldwide did not have access to FSD, with no word on when it was going to release. Just yesterday it began rolling out to the highlands."

1c1eqh4,kz44xwn,"you‚Äôll just need to wait a little longer, but it‚Äôs nothing to do with HW4 or USS at this point"
1c1eqh4,kz4jrdv,"Correct. Basically ignoring the system when the screen starts blinking blue for so long that the car turns off autopilot and forces you to take the wheel. Or using your phone while on autopilot, that will also force disengagements quick."

11ap03o,j9t6uq9,Hands or interior camera?
11ap03o,j9uddin,"Genuine question, not a troll. How are you getting these strikes? I've had FSD beta for 6 months, I'm running 2022.44.30.10, and I barely see even the blue warning flash on screen let alone get strikes.

I drive in the USA, so sitting in the left seat of the car. Generally my right arm rests on the armrest and my left on the door armrest. One or more of my hands is *always* holding the wheel with at least a finger and thumb, and I habitually apply turning force at random intervals. I *never* use a phone while driving, I *never* drive hands-free, and I rarely (like, almost never) see ""apply steering force"" or the blue wash appearing to warn me.

So... how do you do it? What's different? Genuinely curious."
11ap03o,j9tfy5t,You can scroll the max speed and have that count as your movement
11ap03o,j9t9hwt,"What update are you on? I wonder if this has something to do with v11, which merges the city and highway stacks for FSD? I know you don‚Äôt have FSD on."
11ap03o,j9tcq8g,Yes
11ap03o,j9txqfg,Yeah it's a thing now unfortunately
11ap03o,j9u8t8g,This has always been a thing
11ap03o,j9ucagw,"Yeah, even if you turn off the beta, you cannot escape the 5 strikes policy on builds that support the beta.

That‚Äôs been the behavior ever since the lockout was introduced."
11ap03o,j9v8sa4,"I don't get what the problem is.  I have had FSD beta for almost a year and haven't gotten a single strike to date.  I've seen the blue warning, heeded it and haven't had a problem.  It seems to be working as intended."
11ap03o,j9t7jqf,Hands.  And no FSD beta turned on. Just normal autopilot
11ap03o,j9uiguu,"Same here, except the length of ownership. 

I find Im instinctively pulling in the opposite direction of what the car is just doing just in case it does something wonky, I‚Äôm not completely caught off guard. Occasionally I get the ‚Äúapply torque‚Äù notification when I get complacent and that‚Äôs my cue to adjust my steering wheel holding position. 0 strikes."
11ap03o,j9uuqky,[deleted]
11ap03o,j9vt48u,"I get these. Eyes on the road, no wheel weight, hand chilling on the wheel. Will be just cruising for a while and they‚Äôll pop up angrily and give me a strike. Honestly have to disengage autopilot every half hour for kicks just to avoid it."
11ap03o,j9tg493,"If I had the beta on, I would have been paying more attention to the weight of my hand on the wheel or scrolling like you say.  But just caught off guard with normal autopilot striking out the beta when it‚Äôs not on"
11ap03o,j9tca04,22.44.30.10
11ap03o,j9ucmmg,"ahh, gotcha. Damn, the steering wheel lock out is way to sensitive.  I have my hand constantly on it, with pressure, and it still nags me. I'll press harder and my autopilot will sometimes disengage because of too much pressure.  The sweet spot is tough to find.  They need to loosen up on this, especially with the camera watching your eyes."
11ap03o,j9tksy5,"Yep. If you have the beta OS installed, you're subject to strikes even if Beta is turned off. Drive safely."
11ap03o,j9uvv9j,Good answer!
11ap03o,j9uau38,You should be paying attention while on autopilot.
11ap03o,j9uljlx,do you put the car in drive while your hand is hanging heavy on the wheel? i thought i read people were haveing it be extra sensitive because they had there hand on the wheel when they go in drive and tesla is trying to beat those anti-nag weights on wheels
11ap03o,j9ttz1m,This
11ap03o,j9ubrh5,I definitely am... My hand is on the steering wheel too.. it just needs a lot more pressure now. This gets annoying because I'll give it more pressure and this will sometimes disengage the autopilot.
11ap03o,j9uwfxg,"Im not sure, i don't think I have it heavy on the wheel when I do. But I'm going to have to see and try that"
11ap03o,j9udvbt,When the request for torque on the wheel appears the car is looking for a change in torque. A hand resting on the wheel could be interpreted as just a weight.
s9j7bt,htn8pov,"I've gotten some weird lane changes here and there.  Mostly it seems to not want to be in the right lane.

*That being said*, it does appear to be watching behind you as well.  I forget which version it was, I'd have to dig up the write up I did, however, the car changed me from the left lane to the right lane, which I thought was weird because I had to be in the left lane, however, I was then passed by a vehicle that had been behind me.

So it appears that, to some extent, the vehicle recognizes that it is being an obstruction to faster traffic and tries to get out of the way of faster moving traffic.

Not sure if that relates to your scenario or not, but it is a behavior I've observed."
s9j7bt,htnfrps,"Yes, I've noticed more unnecessary lane changes. The release notes for this version do say they've changed the model that handles this:

> Improved lane preference and topology estimation by 1.2% with network update and a new format for navigation clues.

I think on average the new format is working better, and I've noticed it is less likely to actually be in a position to miss a turn, but there are some cases where it makes strange decisions that it winds up having to correct for."
s9j7bt,htngpr7,"I can confirm this happens occasionally to me as well.  I disengage and report every time.  I can usually re-engage after 10-20 seconds and it will not attempt to change lanes again.

It's definitely ""Changing lanes to follow route"" and not ""Changing lanes to faster lane"" or ""Changing lanes out of passing lane"""
s9j7bt,htok5rg,I definitely done understand the random lane changes. I tell it to get over cause I know I am turning right in 2 blocks. It moves back over to the left lane.
s9j7bt,htp854e,"I‚Äôm experiencing this on 10.9. It‚Äôll make the wrong lane change at the wrong time (one intersection, it‚Äôll move from left to right lane while in the of the interaction, there is strange painted lines but it was fixed with 10.8.1 but came back in 10.9). 

10.8.1 was really great for me, best version yet"
s9j7bt,htn9upk,"This is because FSD doesn't work, never had worked, and likely never will work.

Then, occasionally it will work, then not work again. 

All this really means is that FSD is complete farce."
s9j7bt,hto6f4n,Oh that‚Äôs interesting - I‚Äôll keep an eye on it to see if some of the lane changes might be tied to this.
s9j7bt,htnggfo,">doesn't work, never had worked, and likely never will work.  
>  
>occasionally it will work

Seems to be a paradox there"
s9j7bt,htofh0z,"Yeah.  I've had it do this a few times.

In other cases the lane changes seems straight up random though,  so it varies."
zzgpqn,j2bpog0,"Sorry you had such a bad experience, overall the way Valerie treated you is despicable. I just had service done at the Raleigh service center (replaced my back glass due to no defrost function) and they were super amenable, gave me a loaner, got it done before end of day. Tesla service still needs to work on consistency I suppose. Meanwhile, I‚Äôd send your experience to Elon, that is, if he isn‚Äôt too busy with Twitter‚Ä¶"
zzgpqn,j2byb5p,"I bought my car from the Raleigh location and sometimes even on the sale side communication lagged longer than I would have liked, but I (fingers crossed) haven‚Äôt had any service issues come up in my 13k miles. The spoiler is starting to come on my MYP, but hopefully remote service can handle that. I wonder how the Charlotte location is? I‚Äôll be moving to Greensboro in a bit, so maybe I‚Äôd have better luck there than Raleigh if the need arises. Sucks Tesla service is still struggling though."
zzgpqn,j2cbvp8,Ouch.  Yeah I‚Äôd tweet at Elon and reply to any feedback surveys and be honest and let them know that you hoped for and expected better.  Absolutely shouldn‚Äôt ever have to deal with this in the first place but only way they can improve.
zzgpqn,j2eupfq,Tesla service in general needs a lot of work. They are consistently inconsistent.
zzgpqn,j2eu9yz,East coast service centers are terrible in general
zzgpqn,j2fnn3u,Tesla service center in Raleigh dented my brand new MYP replacing the back windshield. They gave the car back to me leaving it to my responsibility to report it to them then they tried to say it wasn‚Äôt them. Here is image: https://imgur.com/a/BdJXbQz
zzgpqn,j2c2mas,"The few interactions I've had with the Charlotte location, including delivery, were top notch. The reps and the mechanics knew their cars and the customer service business."
zzgpqn,j2d54xv,"Elon is too busy goading the libs on Twitter to worry about the pathetic customer service at Tesla. Just another reason to consider using alternatives to both these companies. It seems Musk is not a very good CEO, or just doesn't care anymore."
